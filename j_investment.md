## Types of Investment

Here is the information page about investment, which is mainly two types (passive and active). However, recently algorithm investment is becoming a hot topic, which might be in the middle of two standards. You can see my position about which is better in the article, titled [Will index funds continue to beat active funds?](/business/finance/2021/05/25/will-index-funds-continue-to-beat-active-funds.html).

## Arbitrage Pricing Theory

It can be said active and passive (index) investment are still in a state of confrontation, which means Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) and Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) are also. These airticles are related to APT (main part of financial engineering).
