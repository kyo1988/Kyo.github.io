### Specification Gates

**DoP Gate**: Pass if **weighted MAD ≤ 0.015** (or **BCa 95% upper ≤ 0.020**), with invariants and negative control satisfied.
`MAD = Σ_A w_A · mean_B | P(B|A) − Pen(B) |`, where `w_A` is buyer-weighted share.
**Precondition**: median brands per user ≥ 2.

**DJ Gate**: Pass if **Pearson r ≥ 0.80** and **BCa 95% lower ≥ 0.70**. Window/min_buyers must be stated.

## Background

This analysis evaluates four core marketing science principles using real-world data:

- **Double Jeopardy (DJ)**: The relationship between brand penetration and purchase frequency among buyers
- **Duplication of Purchase (DoP)**: How buyers of one brand also purchase other brands in the same category
- **Category Entry Points (CEP)**: Brand coverage across different market segments and languages
- **Buyer Moderation**: How purchase behavior varies across different buyer segments (quantiles)

Each analysis employs specification-compliant statistical methods including BCa Bootstrap, real temporal randomization, and negative controls to ensure production-ready results.

## Strategic Decision Framework

| Analysis | Status | Key Result | Implication |
|----------|--------|------------|-------------|
| **Double Jeopardy** | ❌ FAIL | r = 0.627 (target: ≥0.80) | Weak penetration-frequency relationship |
| **Duplication of Purchase** | ❌ NEAR-MISS | MAD = 0.015863 (gap: +0.000863) | Close to theoretical threshold |
| **Category Entry Points** | ✅ COMPLETE | Wilson CI, H1 correlation analysis | Successful multilingual analysis |
| **Moderation Analysis** | ✅ COMPLETE | Q4 slope = 3.341, R² = 0.472 | Strong quantile effects |
| **Dirichlet Model** | ⚠️ ILLUSTRATIVE | R² = -7.0e-06 | Weak fit due to high variance |

## Key Achievements

### 1. Specification-Compliant Implementation

**Claim.** Our production-grade implementation employs rigorous statistical methods across all analyses.

**Evidence.** We utilize BCa Bootstrap (B=5000, seed=42) for reproducibility, implement real weekly shuffle for actual temporal randomization, and maintain proper negative controls for statistical validation.

**Implication.** This approach ensures that our results meet production research standards and provide reliable insights into marketing science principles.

**Limits.** Results are sensitive to buyer weighting and temporal windows; stationarity tests and negative controls are reported in the appendix.

### 2. Near-Miss Achievement

**Why "Near-Miss" matters.** The strict gate for DoP is **weighted MAD ≤ 0.015**. Our best result hits **0.015863**, i.e., `gap = +0.000863`, with full validation (BCa B=5,000; weekly shuffle; invariants). This suggests the threshold is **approachable** under certain category/window choices, though not crossed yet.

**Validation signals.** The **invariant** `Σ_A w_A·D(A→B) ≈ Pen(B)` holds with a mean absolute error of 0.0032. A **label-shuffle** negative control degrades MAD to 0.0421, confirming signal beyond chance. Median brands per user = 2.0 (≥2 required), so the cohort supports DoP interpretation.

### 3. Real-World Data Insights

**Claim.** Real-world marketing data exhibits characteristics that challenge theoretical marketing science models.

**Evidence.** Purchase behavior shows extreme variability (std = 181.9), marketing science principles vary across categories, and non-stationary data affects analysis validity.

**Implication.** These findings suggest that theoretical models require adaptation for real-world applications, with careful consideration of data quality and statistical assumptions.

**Limits.** Results are specific to the analyzed categories and time periods; broader generalization requires additional validation across diverse datasets.

## Analysis Results Summary

### Double Jeopardy Analysis ❌

**Result**: Pearson r = 0.627 (target: ≥0.80)
**Failure Analysis**: DJ relationship failure stems from multiple factors that collectively undermine the theoretical marketing science principle. The limited brand count (n=16) provides insufficient data for stable correlation estimation, while the buyer threshold (min=500) excludes marginal brands that might strengthen the relationship. Additionally, the 26-week time window may be too short for purchase frequency patterns to stabilize, contributing to the weak correlation observed.

- **Brand Count Impact**: n_brands = 16 (insufficient for stable correlation)
- **Buyer Threshold**: min_buyers = 500 (excludes marginal brands)
- **Time Window**: 26 weeks (may be too short for frequency stabilization)

**Sensitivity Analysis**: Parameter sensitivity analysis reveals that DJ relationship weakness is inherent to beauty category data rather than a methodological issue. While lowering the buyer threshold to 300 provides minimal improvement (r=0.634), extending the time window to 52 weeks actually reduces correlation strength, confirming that the weak relationship is data-specific and requires strategic pivot rather than parameter optimization.

| Window | Min Buyers | Pearson r | Spearman r | Implication |
|--------|------------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| 26 weeks | 300 | 0.634 | 0.571 | Lower threshold improves |
| 26 weeks | 500 | 0.627 | 0.562 | Baseline |
| 26 weeks | 1000 | 0.598 | 0.548 | Higher threshold reduces |
| 52 weeks | 300 | 0.612 | 0.555 | Longer window + lower threshold |
| 52 weeks | 500 | 0.589 | 0.534 | Longer window reduces |
| 52 weeks | 1000 | 0.556 | 0.512 | Both constraints reduce |

**Implication**: Weak brand penetration-frequency relationship due to data constraints
**Evidence**: [assets/evidence/dj_bodycare.csv](/assets/evidence/dj_bodycare.csv)

### Duplication of Purchase Analysis ❌

**Best Result**: dunnhumby beauty MAD = 0.015863 (gap: +0.000863)
**Comparison**: Instacart shampoo MAD = 0.021854
**Implication**: Close to theoretical threshold but not achieved
**Evidence**: [assets/evidence/dop_dunnhumby_beauty_spec_q90_b2_m20.csv](/assets/evidence/dop_dunnhumby_beauty_spec_q90_b2_m20.csv)

### Category Entry Points Analysis ✅

**Result**: Complete multilingual analysis with Wilson CI
**H1 Correlation**: Pearson = -0.28, Spearman = -0.59
**Implication**: Higher penetration correlates with lower coverage
**Evidence**: [assets/evidence/cep_coverage_complete.csv](/assets/evidence/cep_coverage_complete.csv)

### Moderation Analysis ✅

**Result**: Strong quantile effects (Q4 slope = 3.341)
**Implication**: Heavy buyers show strongest relationships
**Evidence**: [assets/evidence/moderation_bodycare.csv](/assets/evidence/moderation_bodycare.csv)

### Dirichlet Model Analysis ⚠️

**Result**: R² = -7.0e-06 (very poor fit)
**Scope Limitation**: Designed for **category × brand × buyer distribution** panel data
**Excluded Data**: SKU-level, review data, and non-panel sources are **out of scope**
**Implication**: Theoretical model struggles with real-world data complexity
**Evidence**: [assets/evidence/dirichlet_bodycare.csv](/assets/evidence/dirichlet_bodycare.csv)

## Simplified vs. Specification-Compliant

### Simplified Version Results

- **Purpose**: Demonstration and quick validation
- **Method**: Unweighted MAD, estimated weekly shuffle
- **Results**: 2 PASS examples achieved
- **Use Case**: Educational purposes, proof-of-concept

### Specification-Compliant Version Results

- **Purpose**: Production-ready statistical analysis
- **Method**: Weighted MAD, BCa (B=5000, seed=42), real weekly shuffle
- **Results**: Near-miss achievement, no strict PASS
- **Use Case**: Research publication, statistical validation

## Synthesis

The specification-compliant implementation reveals why achieving PASS examples is challenging: brand purchase count–weighted MAD increases stringency compared to unweighted calculations, while category dynamics and temporal instability contribute to DJ analysis failures. The CEP and moderation results complement these findings by demonstrating successful multilingual analysis and robust quantile-based buyer segmentation, respectively, suggesting that some marketing science principles are more applicable than others in real-world contexts.

## Limitations and Threats to Validity

These results are contingent on category selection, temporal windowing, and minimum buyer thresholds. In particular, brand-count weighting increases stringency in DoP; non-stationarity and heterogeneous purchase variance attenuate DJ and Dirichlet fits. We report full audit logs and input SHAs to support replication.
