&lt;h1 id=&quot;sales-forecasting-2&quot;&gt;SALES FORECASTING 2&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this section, it is assumed a pizza parlor business plan in the Bath University has lunched.  The vital issue of the plan is also done so to find one or two pizzas which might be appealed by the Bath University students based on the attributions such as type of topping and base.  Hence, it will be conducted an experiment to attempt diverse pizzas for the target consumers including the students.  However, there are some constrictions for the plan, one of which is the maximum budget of £100 to purchase the pizzas for this experiment.  One of the major tools to find the customer preferences can be conjoint analysis which assumed their preferences as a combination of the attributions having a certain degree &lt;cite&gt;(Janssens et al., 2008)&lt;/cite&gt;.  Therefore, it should be decided that which attributions might be the most relevant to the purpose that is to find the most preferred among the students.  The consideration relevant to the attributions was started from the research suggesting 5 attributions which are the crust, topping, cheese type, cheese quality and price &lt;cite&gt;(Lilien and Rangaswamy, 2002)&lt;/cite&gt;.  The crust has 3 levels which are thin, thick, pan.  Topping’s levels are pineapple, veggie, chicken, turkey.  The levels of cheese type are Romano, mixed, mozzarella.  These of cheese quality are 50g, 75g, 100g.  £4.99, £6.99, £8.99 are the level of price.  As a result, the total possible combinations of attribute levels are 324 (= 3 x 4 x 3 x 3 x 3).  All of them cannot be conducted due to the time and budget restrictions, however, some researchers argued the effective number of part worth parameters to be approximated from conjoint data, the number of which is less than the sum of all levels of each attribution (Wierenga, 2008).  Thus, if at most 16 (= 3 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 3) candidates are selected precisely, these alternatives can be represented all of the possible combinations of attribute levels (ibid).  The selection usually is done by SPSS from all of attribute levels and therefore, the data format to save 16 alternatives representing all possibilities should be suitable for the application.  Furthermore, the data structure of that should be 16 rows with at least 7 columns which are 5 attributions, the primary key and the preference score.  The most well-liked pizza should the maximum preference score (one hundred) and the minimum one (zero) should be rated to the least popular pizza.  Hence. Each pizza must have the preference score from 0 to 100.  Conjoint analysis assumes the preference score can be represented the weighted sum of the utilities for each attribution &lt;cite&gt;(Wierenga, 2008)&lt;/cite&gt;.  This means after collecting the score from the customers being tested, the software (SPSS) can discover weights and utilities of each attributions.  In addition, the key is required to identify each rows, however, it is automatically inserted (see the leftist column of figure 1) when the data is inputted in the data format and then also accordingly the column named ‘STATUS’ with ‘Design’ as the value is inserted as a result of using the function to generate the orthogonal design &lt;cite&gt;(Janssens et al., 2008)&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/djiyxp5ax/image/upload/v1623989695/Figure_1_gtuehf.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 1&quot; title=&quot;Figure 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, although it should be tested 16 type of pizzas to collect the target customer preference as the score, there is the budged limitation which the pizzas only can be purchased less than 100 pounds.  This means if assumed the price of normal size pizza is 15 pounds, 6 pizzas are able to be bought for the experiment.  Supposed the shop selected to buy the pizzas can allow to consume at least 3 type of the alternatives among 16 of that in the same pizza, 18 different type of pizza is available for the test.  Therefore, all of alternatives are able to be examined with only 2 duplicates (16 = 18 - 2).  Because of the fact that 6 students are applicable for the evaluation, if each student can eat and rate all of alternatives to cut each piece into 6 parts, the preferable scores of them are able to be collected.  Figure 2 is assumed the result of the 16 alternative pizzas rating by 6 students (identified by id in the figure).  For instance, the column named ‘sco1’ means the students (identified by id in the figure 2) rating score for the top row in the figure 1 (Card ID 1 row).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/djiyxp5ax/image/upload/v1623989696/Figure_2_k2ig2k.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 2&quot; title=&quot;Figure 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The utilities of each attributions are estimated by the software, SPSS.  In Figure 3, it is seen apparently that the attribution ‘thin’ (assigned to ‘Crust’ level) has the highest utility (5.708) and the lowest utility (-4.010) is earned by the attribution ‘pineapple’ (belonged to ‘Topping’ level). 
Utilities&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/djiyxp5ax/image/upload/v1623989695/Figure_3_bghixu.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 3&quot; title=&quot;Figure 3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, Figure 4 shows the averaged importance for each levels of the attributions which mean which levels can earn the highest utility.  In the figure, the level ‘Topping’ has the highest one (22.503) and the lowest one (17.930) is gained by the level ‘Price’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/djiyxp5ax/image/upload/v1623989695/Figure_4_qdicuj.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 4&quot; title=&quot;Figure 4&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Figure 5 indicates that both the Pearson’s R (.864) and the Kendall’s tau (.639) which mean the correlations between the recognized and forecasted preferences are high (ibid).  both correlations also are likely to be significant (respectively .000 and .000) because less than .05 significance means the null hypothesis of a null correlation is quite unlikely to be acceptable (ibid). 
Correlations2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/djiyxp5ax/image/upload/v1623989695/Figure_5_qxihdw.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 5&quot; title=&quot;Figure 5&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Figures 6 through 10, the relative utility levels are demonstrated for each attribute and In Figure 11, the mean importance is displayed for each attribute (ibid).  From Figures 6 through 11, it could be seen that the pizza parlor that offers their customers a thin of crust, Veggie of topping, Romano of cheese type, 50g of cheese quantity and pricing £8.99 might achieve the highest utility.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#reference&quot; id=&quot;markdown-toc-reference&quot;&gt;Reference&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;organize-and-implement-hull-and-white-1994a-interest-rate-model&quot;&gt;Organize and implement Hull and White (1994a) interest rate model&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;derivation-of-hull-and-white-1994a-interest-rate-model-solutions-and-boundary-conditions&quot;&gt;Derivation of Hull and White (1994a) interest rate model solutions and boundary conditions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Definition [Hull and White(1994a) interest rate model]
\begin{eqnarray}\label{HullandWhite1994a}
dr(t)=(\theta(t)-ar(t))dt+\sigma d\tilde{W}(t) ．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, $\tilde{W}(t)$ is Brownian motion under the risk-neutral measure $\mathbb{P}$.
Also, $\theta (t)$, $a$, and $\sigma$ are positive-definite functions for time (Hull and White, 1994a).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Definition [Discount bond price evaluation formula]
\begin{eqnarray}\label{DiscountBondPrice}
B(t,T)=\tilde{\mathbb{E}}[e^{-\int_{t}^{T}R(s)ds}|{\cal F}(t)] ．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, a discount bond is a contract in which $1$ is paid for a certain fixed maturity of $T$, and no payment is made before the maturity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Definition [Yield from time $t$ to $T$]
\begin{eqnarray}
Y(t,T)=-\frac{1}{T-t}\log B(t,T)．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is equivalent to the following equation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
B(t,T)=e^{-Y(t,T)(T-t)}．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, $B(T, T) =1$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The random variable $e^{-\int_{t}^{T}R(s)ds}$ estimated in the equation \eqref{DiscountBondPrice} depends not only on $R(T)$ but also on the path. However, the path of $R$ to time $t$ depends only on $R(t)$ at time $t$. Therefore, since $R$ is a Markov process, the bond price $B(t, T)$ is considered to be a function of time $t$ and $R(t)$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
B(t,T)=f(t,R(t))．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, since the equation \eqref{DiscountBondPrice} is the expansion of $D(t)B(t,T)=\tilde{\Bbb{E}}[D(T)B(T,T))\lvert\cal{F}(t)]$, then $D(t)B(t,T)=D(t)f(t,T)$ is a martingale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, in order for the no arbitrage condition to hold, the drift $(dt)$ term obtained by differentiating $D(t)f(t,T)$ must appear as $0$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To find the derivative of $D(t)f(t,T)$, it is required first to find the discount process and its relational expression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Definition [discount process]
\begin{eqnarray}
D(t)=e^{-\int_{0}^{t}R(s)ds}．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, if $S(x)=e(-t)$ and $I(t)=\int_{0}^{t}R(s)ds$, then $D(t) = S(I(t))$.
At this time, since $dI(t)=R(t)dt$, $dI(t)dI (t)=0$ and $S’(x)=-S (x)$, $S’‘(x) =S(x)$ then from Ito’s lemma,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
dD(t)=dS(I(t)) 
=S’(I(t))dI(t)+\frac{1}{2}S’‘(I(t))dI(t)dI(t) 
=-S(I(t))dI(t) 
=-D(t)R(t)dt．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;therefore,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
dD(t)=-D(t)R(t)dt．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the interest rate process $R(t)$ in finding the derivative of $D(t)f(t,T)$ follows the equation \eqref{HullandWhite1994a}, then From $dtdt=0$, $dtd\tilde{W}=0$, $d\tilde{W}d\tilde{W}=dt$ and $drdr= \sigma^2dt$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
d(D(t)f(t,T))
=f(t,T)dD(t)+D(t)df(t,T)
=f(t,T)(-D(t)R(t))+D(t){f_t(t,T)dt+f_r(t,T)dr+\frac{1}{2}f_rr(t,T)drdr} 
=D(t)(-rf(t,T)+f_t(t,T)+\frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 f_rr(t,T)+(\theta(t)-ar(t))f_r(t,T))dt+D(t)\sigma f_r(t,T)d\tilde{W}(t)．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, $f(t, T))$ must be met.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}\label{HullWhitePDE}
f_t(t,T)+\frac{1}{2}\sigma^{2} f_rr(t,T)+(\theta(t)-ar(t))f_r(t,T)=rf(t,T)
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, since $1=B(T, T)=f(T, r)$, the terminal condition is obtained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all $r$,
\begin{eqnarray}
f(T,r)=1
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, the partial differential equation of the equation \eqref{HullWhitePDE} is expanded to obtain an analytical solution.
If you set $f_t(t, T)=e^{-rC (t, T) -A (t, T)}$,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
f_t(t,r)=(-rC’(t,T)-A’(t,T))f(t,r)． 
f_r(t,r)=-C(t,T)f(t,r)． 
f_rr(t,r)=-C^{2}(t,T)f(t,r)．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where $C’(t,T)=\frac{\partial C(t,T)}{\partial t}$，$A’(t,T)=\frac{\partial A(t,T)}{\partial t}$．
Therefore, the left side of the formula \eqref{HullWhitePDE} is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
f_t(t,T)+\frac{1}{2}\sigma f_rr(t,T)+(\theta(t)-ar(t))f_r(t,T) 
=(-rC’(t,T)-A’(t,T)+\frac{1}{2}\sigma^{2}C^{2}(t,T)-(\theta(t)-ar(t))C(t,T))f(t,r)．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, by transposing the right side to the left side and enclosing it with $r$, the following relational expression is obtained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
((-C’(t,T)+aC(t,T)-1)r-A’(t,T)-\theta(t)C(t,T)+\frac{1}{2}\sigma^{2}C^{2}(t,T))f(t,r)=0．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the assumption, $f_t(t, T)=e^{-rC(t, T)-A(t, T)}&amp;gt;0$, and this relation must hold for all $r$, then this term for $r$ must be $0$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
C’(t,T)=aC(t,T)-1．
A’(t,T)=-\theta(t)C(t,T)+\frac{1}{2}\sigma^{2}C^{2}(t,T)．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, $C(T, T)=A’(T, T)=A(T, T)=0$ is required to hold for the terminal condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A function that satisfies $C’(t, T)=aC(t, T)-1$, $C(T, T)=0$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
C(t,T)=\int_{t}^{T}e^{-\int_{t}^{s}a(v)dv}ds．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is shown that this is a unique solution to be obtained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{d }{d s}(e^{-\int_{0}^{s}a(v)dv} C(s,T))
=e^{-\int_{0}^{s}a(v)dv}(-a(s)C(s,T)+C’(s,T) ) 
=e^{-\int_{0}^{s}a(v)dv}(-a(s)C(s,T)+aC(t,T)-1 ) 
=e^{-\int_{0}^{s}a(v)dv}．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Integrating both sides of this equation from $t$ to $T$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
e^{-\int_{0}^{T}a(v)dv}C(T,T)-e^{-\int_{0}^{t}a(v)dv}C(t,T)=-\int_{t}^{T}e^{-\int_{0}^{s}a(v)dv}ds 
\Leftrightarrow C(t,T)=e^{\int_{0}^{t}a(v)dv}\int_{t}^{T}e^{-\int_{0}^{s}a(v)dv}ds&lt;br /&gt;
=\int_{t}^{T}e^{-\int_{t}^{s}a(v)dv}ds．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expansion of this unique solution is as follows. However, $a(v)=a$ is set from the equation \eqref{HullandWhite1994a}.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
C(t,T)=\int_{t}^{T}e^{-\int_{t}^{s}a(v)dv}ds 
=\int_{t}^{T}e^{-as+at}ds 
=\frac{1}{a}(1-e^{-a(T-t)})．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the function, that satisfies $A(T, T)=1$, $A’(t, T)=-\theta(t)C(t, T)+\frac{1}{2}\sigma^{2}C^{2}(t, T)$, is shown below as a unique solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
A(t,T)=\int_{t}^{T}(\theta(t)C(t,T)-\frac{1}{2}\sigma^{2}C^{2}(t,T) )ds．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Integrating both sides of this equation from $t$ to $T$
\begin{eqnarray}
A(T,T)-A(t,T)=-\int_{t}^{T}\theta(t)C(t,T)ds+\frac{1}{2}\int_{t}^{T}\sigma^{2}C^{2}(t,T)ds 
\Leftrightarrow A(t,T)=\int_{t}^{T}(\theta(t)C(t,T)-\frac{1}{2}\sigma^{2}C^{2}(t,T))ds．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expansion of this unique solution is as follows. However, $a(v)=a$ is set from the equation \eqref{HullandWhite1994a}.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
A(t,T)=\int_{t}^{T}(\theta(t)C(t,T)-\frac{1}{2}\sigma^{2}C^{2}(t,T) )ds 
=\int_{t}^{T}(\frac{\theta(t)}{a}(1-e^{-a(T-t)})-\frac{1}{2}\sigma^{2}\frac{1}{a^2}(1-e^{-a(T-t)} )^{2} )ds 
=\frac{\sigma^{2}}{2a^3}(-a(T-t)+2(1-e^{-a(T-t)})-\frac{1}{2}(1-e^{-2a(T-t)})) 
+\frac{1}{a}\int_{t}^{T}\theta(s)(1-e^{-a(T-s)})ds．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, the parameter $\theta(t)$ in the equation \eqref{HullandWhite1994a} means the speed of mean reversion. It is required to match this parameter to the term structure of the quoted interest rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Definition [Instantaneous Forward Rate]
Let $f^{M}(0, T)$ be the instantaneous forward rate of the market at maturity $T$ at time $0$.
\begin{eqnarray}
f^{M}(0,T)=-\frac{\partial \ln B^{M}(0,T)}{\partial T}．
\end{eqnarray}
Here, $B^{M}(0, T)$ is the discount bond price quoted in the market at maturity $T$.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because it is $B(t,T)=f(t,r)=e^{-rC(t,T)-A(t,T)}$，&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
\ln B(0,T)=-rC(0,T)-A(0,T) 
=-\frac{r}{a}(1-e^{-aT} ) 
-\frac{\sigma^{2}}{2a^3}(-aT+2(1-e^{-aT})-\frac{1}{2}(1-e^{-2aT})) 
+\frac{1}{a}\int_{0}^{T}\theta(s)(1-e^{-a(T-s)})ds 
\Leftrightarrow \frac{\partial \ln B^{M}(0,T)}{\partial T}=re^{-aT}+\frac{\sigma^{2}}{2a^3}(-a+2ae^{-aT}+e^{-2aT})+\int_{t}^{T}\theta(s)e^{-a(T-s)}ds 
\Leftrightarrow f^{M}(0,T)=re^{-aT}+\frac{\sigma^{2}}{2a^3}(-a+2ae^{-aT}+e^{-2aT})+\int_{t}^{T}\theta(s)e^{-a(T-s)}ds．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following relationship is used to derive $\theta(T)$ from $f^{M}(0, T)$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
H(t)=\int_{0}^{t}h(s,t)dsarrow H’(t)=\int_{0}^{t}\frac{\partial h(s,t)}{\partial t}ds+h(t,t)．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, $x(t)=re^{-at}+\int_{0}^{t}\theta(s)e^{-a(t-s)}ds$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
x’(t)=-a(re^{-at}+\int_{0}^{t}\theta(s)e^{-a(t-s)}ds)+\theta(t) 
x’(t)=-ax(t)+\theta(t) 
\Leftrightarrow \theta(t)=x’(t)+ax(t) 
arrow \theta(T)=x’(T)+ax(T)．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if it is set $g(t)=\frac{\sigma^2}{2a^2}(-1+2e^{-at}+e^{-2at})$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
f^{M}(0,T)=x(T)+g(T) 
\Leftrightarrow x(T)=f^{M}(0,T)-g(T)．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore 
\begin{eqnarray}
\theta(T)=\frac{\partial f^{M}(0,T)}{\partial T}-\frac{\partial g(T)}{\partial T}+ax(t)．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, since it is $\frac{\partial g(T)}{\partial T}=-\frac{\sigma^2}{a}(e^{-aT}+e^{-2aT})$, the following equation is obtained after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
\theta(T)=\frac{\partial f^{M}(0,T)}{\partial T}+\frac{\sigma^2}{a}(e^{-aT}+e^{-2aT})+af^{M}(0,T)-\frac{\sigma^2}{2a^2}(-1+2e^{-at}+e^{-2at})．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hull-and-white-tree-formulation&quot;&gt;Hull and White Tree formulation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the following, to represent the interest rate model as the $3$ term tree, it is derived the relational expression between the parameters of the continuous time process and the parameters of the $3$ term process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the $3$ term process, it is expressed by $p_u$, $p_m$, and $p_d$, respectively, during the minute time $\Delta t$ as the interest rate rises by the spatial division width $\Delta x$, or stays at the same level, decreasing by $\Delta x$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, $\Delta t$ and $\Delta x$ cannot be selected independently and must satisfy the conditions for stability and convergence of the finite difference method $\Delta x=\sigma \sqrt{3\Delta t}$ (Hull and White, 1994).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, if the drift term of the formula \eqref{HullandWhite1994a} is set $\nu=\theta(t)-ar(t)$,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}\label{averrageA}
\mathbb{E}[\Delta x]=p_u(\Delta x)+p_m(0)+p_d(-\Delta x)=\nu\Delta t．
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{eqnarray}\label{varianceA}
\mathbb{E}[\Delta x^2]=p_u(\Delta x^2)+p_m(0)+p_d(-\Delta x^2)=\sigma^2\Delta t+\nu^2\Delta t^2．
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{eqnarray}\label{SumProA}
p_u+p_m+p_d=1．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expression \eqref{averrageA} and the expression \eqref{varianceA} are expanded as follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}\label{averrageAA}
p_u\Delta x-p_d\Delta x=\nu \Delta t．
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{eqnarray}\label{varianceAA}
p_u\Delta x^2-p_d\Delta x^2=\sigma^2\Delta t+\nu^2\Delta t^2．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiply the expression \eqref{averrageAA} by $\Delta x$ and add the expression \eqref{varianceAA},&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}\label{puA}
2p_u\Delta x^2=\nu^2\Delta t^2+\sigma^2\Delta t+\nu \Delta t\Delta x 
p_u=\frac{1}{2}(\frac{\nu^2\Delta t^2+\sigma^2\Delta t}{\Delta x^2}+\frac{\nu \Delta t}{\Delta x} )．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, substituting the expression \eqref{puA} into the expression \eqref{averrageAA},&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
p_u\Delta x-p_d\Delta x=\frac{1}{2}(\frac{\nu^2\Delta t^2+\sigma^2\Delta t}{\Delta x^2}+\frac{\nu \Delta t}{\Delta x} )\Delta x-p_d\Delta x 
\Leftrightarrow p_d\Delta x=\frac{1}{2}(\frac{\nu^2\Delta t^2+\sigma^2\Delta t}{\Delta x^2}-\frac{\nu \Delta t}{\Delta x} )\Delta x&lt;br /&gt;
p_d=\frac{1}{2}(\frac{\nu^2\Delta t^2+\sigma^2\Delta t}{\Delta x^2}-\frac{\nu \Delta t}{\Delta x} )．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if it is substituted the expression \eqref{puA} and the expression \eqref{puA} into the expression \eqref{SumProA}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}\label{pmA}
p_u+p_m+p_d=\frac{1}{2}(\frac{\nu^2\Delta t^2+\sigma^2\Delta t}{\Delta x^2}+\frac{\nu \Delta t}{\Delta x} )+p_m+\frac{1}{2}(\frac{\nu^2\Delta t^2+\sigma^2\Delta t}{\Delta x^2}-\frac{\nu \Delta t}{\Delta x} ) 
=\frac{\nu^2\Delta t^2+\sigma^2\Delta t}{\Delta x^2}+p_m 
\Leftrightarrow p_m=1-\frac{\nu^2\Delta t^2+\sigma^2\Delta t}{\Delta x^2}．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hull And White (1994a) proposed a method for constructing an efficient and accurate short rate for the equation \eqref{HullandWhite1994a}. Also, it is assumed $\theta(t)=0$，$r(0)=0$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
dr(t)=ar(t)dt+\sigma d\tilde{W}(t) ．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, note that $\nu=-ar$. In this simplified tree, the value of $r$ at the time $i\Delta t$ is $j\Delta t$. Since the tree is designed to reduce the amount of calculation, $j$ needs to be between $BottomNode[i]$ and $TopNode[i]$. The choice of which branching process to take at each node depends on the sign of $a$ and the size of $j$, and the range of change $\Delta x(=\Delta r)$ in the simplified $r$ process is chosen to match the expected value of $\mathbb{E}[\Delta x]$ and the variance $Var(\Delta x)$. Furthermore, when $a$ is positive, if $M$ is the expected value of the fluctuation range, when $j$ is the smallest integer larger than $-0.184/M$, the standard branching process is switched to the downward branching process. In order to maintain the symmetry, HW proposes to switch from the standard branching process to the upward branching process in the node $j$ with a negative sign for this node (Hull and White, 1994).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here，
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathbb{E}[\Delta x]=\nu \Delta t 
=-ar\Delta t 
=Mr 
\Leftrightarrow M=-a\Delta t．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also，
\begin{eqnarray}
Var(\Delta x)=\mathbb{E}[\Delta x^2]-(\mathbb{E}[\Delta x])^2 
=(\nu^2\Delta t^2+\sigma^2\Delta t)-(\nu \Delta t)^2 
=\sigma^2\Delta t．
\end{eqnarray}
It becomes. Here,$M^2=a^2\Delta t^2$，$r=j\Delta r$,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}\label{ExForPb1}
\frac{\nu^2\Delta t^2+\sigma^2\Delta t}{\Delta x^2}=\frac{(-ar)^2\Delta t^2+\sigma^2\Delta t}{ (\sigma \sqrt(3\Delta t))^2} 
=\frac{(-a\Delta t)^2r^2+\sigma^2\Delta t}{ 3\sigma^2 \Delta t} 
=\frac{M^2(j\Delta r)^2+\sigma^2\Delta t}{ 3\sigma^2 \Delta t} 
=\frac{1}{3}\frac{j^2 M^2 \Delta r^2+\sigma^2\Delta t}{ \sigma^2 \Delta t} 
=\frac{1}{3}\frac{j^2 M^2 \Delta r^2}{ \sigma^2 \Delta t}+\frac{1}{3} 
=\frac{1}{3}\frac{j^2 M^2 (3\sigma^2 \Delta t)}{ \sigma^2 \Delta t}+\frac{1}{3} 
=j^2M^2+\frac{1}{3}．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore from the formula \eqref{ExForPb1},
\begin{eqnarray}
p_m=1-\frac{\nu^2\Delta t^2+\sigma^2\Delta t}{\Delta x^2} 
=1-(j^2M^2+\frac{1}{3}) 
=\frac{2}{3}-j^2M^2．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand,
\begin{eqnarray}\label{ExForPb2}
\frac{\nu\Delta t}{\Delta x}=\frac{(-ar)\Delta t}{\sigma\sqrt(3\Delta t)} 
=\frac{-Mr}{\sigma\sqrt(3\Delta t)} 
=\frac{-jr\Delta r}{\sigma\sqrt(3\Delta t)} 
=\frac{-jr(\sigma\sqrt(3\Delta t))}{\sigma\sqrt(3\Delta t)} 
=-jM．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore from the formula \eqref{ExForPb2},&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
p_u=\frac{1}{2}(\frac{\nu^2\Delta t^2+\sigma^2\Delta t}{\Delta x^2}+\frac{\nu \Delta t}{\Delta x} ) 
=\frac{1}{2}( j^2M^2+\frac{1}{3} -jM ) 
=\frac{1}{6}+\frac{j^2M^2-jM}{2}．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
p_d=\frac{1}{2}(\frac{\nu^2\Delta t^2+\sigma^2\Delta t}{\Delta x^2}-\frac{\nu \Delta t}{\Delta x}) 
=\frac{1}{2}(j^2M^2+\frac{1}{3}+jM) 
=\frac{1}{6}+\frac{j^2M^2+jM}{2}．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, it is derived from the probabilities corresponding to the upward branching process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}\label{averrageB}
\mathbb{E}[\Delta x]=p_u(2\Delta x)+p_m(\Delta x)+p_d(0)=\nu\Delta t．
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{eqnarray}\label{varianceB}
\mathbb{E}[\Delta x^2]=p_u(2\Delta x)^2+p_m(\Delta x^2)+p_d(0)=\sigma^2\Delta t+\nu^2\Delta t^2．
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{eqnarray}\label{SumProB}
p_u+p_m+p_d=1．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expression \eqref{averrageB} and the expression \eqref{varianceB} are expanded as follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}\label{averrageBB}
2p_u\Delta x+p_m\Delta x=\nu \Delta t．
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{eqnarray}\label{varianceBB}
4p_u\Delta x^2+p_m\Delta x^2=\sigma^2\Delta t+\nu^2\Delta t^2．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subtracting the expression \eqref{averrageBB} from the expression \eqref{varianceBB} multiplied by $\Delta x$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}\label{puB}
2p_u\Delta x^2=\nu^2\Delta t^2+\sigma^2\Delta t-\nu \Delta t\Delta x 
p_u=\frac{1}{2}(\frac{\nu^2\Delta t^2+\sigma^2\Delta t}{\Delta x^2}-\frac{\nu \Delta t}{\Delta x} )．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, if it is assigned the expression \eqref{puB} to the expression \eqref{averrageBB},
\begin{eqnarray}\label{pmB}
2p_u\Delta x+p_m\Delta x=\frac{\nu^2\Delta t^2+\sigma^2\Delta t}{\Delta x^2}-\frac{\nu \Delta t}{\Delta x}+p_m\Delta x 
\Leftrightarrow p_m\Delta x=2\nu \Delta t-\frac{\nu^2\Delta t^2+\sigma^2\Delta t}{\Delta x^2}&lt;br /&gt;
\Leftrightarrow p_m=\frac{2\nu \Delta t}{\Delta x}-\frac{\nu^2\Delta t^2+\sigma^2\Delta t}{\Delta x^2}．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if it is substituted the expression \eqref{puB} and the expression \eqref{pmB} into the expression \eqref{SumProB}
\begin{eqnarray}\label{pdB}
p_u+p_m+p_d=\frac{1}{2}(\frac{\nu^2\Delta t^2+\sigma^2\Delta t}{\Delta x^2}-\frac{\nu \Delta t}{\Delta x} )+\frac{2\nu \Delta t}{\Delta x}-\frac{\nu^2\Delta t^2+\sigma^2\Delta t}{\Delta x^2}+p_d 
=\frac{3}{2}\frac{\nu \Delta t}{\Delta x}-\frac{1}{2}\frac{\nu^2\Delta t^2+\sigma^2\Delta t}{\Delta x^2}+p_d 
\Leftrightarrow p_d=1-\frac{1}{2}( \frac{3\nu \Delta t}{\Delta x}-\frac{\nu^2\Delta t^2+\sigma^2\Delta t}{\Delta x^2} ) ．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore from the formula \eqref{ExForPb1},
\begin{eqnarray}
p_u=\frac{1}{2}(\frac{\nu^2\Delta t^2+\sigma^2\Delta t}{\Delta x^2}-\frac{\nu \Delta t}{\Delta x} ) 
=\frac{1}{2}( j^2M^2+\frac{1}{3}-(-jM)) 
=\frac{1}{6}-\frac{j^2M^2+jM}{2}．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
p_m=\frac{2\nu \Delta t}{\Delta x}-\frac{\nu^2\Delta t^2+\sigma^2\Delta t}{\Delta x^2} 
=-2jM-(j^2M^2+\frac{1}{3}) 
=\frac{1}{3}-j^2M^2-2jM．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
p_d=1-\frac{1}{2}( \frac{3\nu \Delta t}{\Delta x}-\frac{\nu^2\Delta t^2+\sigma^2\Delta t}{\Delta x^2} ) 
=1-frac{1}{2}( -3jM-j^2M^2-\frac{1}{3}) 
=\frac{7}{6}+\frac{j^2M^2+3jM}{2}．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, the probability corresponding to the downward branching process is derived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}\label{averrageC}
\mathbb{E}[\Delta x]=p_u(0)+p_m(-\Delta x)+p_d(-2\Delta x)=\nu\Delta t．
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{eqnarray}\label{varianceC}
\mathbb{E}[\Delta x^2]=p_u(0)+p_m(-\Delta x)^2+p_d(-2\Delta x)^2=\sigma^2\Delta t+\nu^2\Delta t^2．
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{eqnarray}\label{SumProC}
p_u+p_m+p_d=1．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expression \eqref{averrageC} and the expression \eqref{varianceC} are expanded as follows.
\begin{eqnarray}\label{averrageCC}
-p_m\Delta x-2p_d\Delta x=\nu \Delta t．
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{eqnarray}\label{varianceCC}
p_m\Delta x^2+4p_d\Delta x^2=\sigma^2\Delta t+\nu^2\Delta t^2．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add the expression \eqref{varianceCC} multiplied by $\Delta x$ and the expression \eqref{averrageCC},
\begin{eqnarray}\label{pdC}
2p_d\Delta x^2=\nu^2\Delta t^2+\sigma^2\Delta t+\nu \Delta t\Delta x 
p_d=\frac{1}{2}(\frac{\nu^2\Delta t^2+\sigma^2\Delta t}{\Delta x^2}+\frac{\nu \Delta t}{\Delta x} )．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, if it is assigned the expression \eqref{pdC} to the expression \eqref{averrageCC},
\begin{eqnarray}\label{pmC}
-p_m\Delta x-2p_d\Delta x=-p_m\Delta x-\frac{\nu^2\Delta t^2+\sigma^2\Delta t}{\Delta x^2}-\frac{\nu \Delta t}{\Delta x} 
\Leftrightarrow -p_m\Delta x=2\nu \Delta t+\frac{\nu^2\Delta t^2+\sigma^2\Delta t}{\Delta x^2}&lt;br /&gt;
\Leftrightarrow p_m=-\frac{2\nu \Delta t}{\Delta x}-\frac{\nu^2\Delta t^2+\sigma^2\Delta t}{\Delta x^2}．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if it is substituted the expression \eqref{pdC} and the expression \eqref{pmC} into the expression \eqref{SumProC},
\begin{eqnarray}\label{puC}
p_u+p_m+p_d=p_u-\frac{2\nu \Delta t}{\Delta x}-\frac{\nu^2\Delta t^2+\sigma^2\Delta t}{\Delta x^2}+\frac{1}{2}(\frac{\nu^2\Delta t^2+\sigma^2\Delta t}{\Delta x^2}+\frac{\nu \Delta t}{\Delta x} ) 
=p_u-\frac{3}{2}\frac{\nu \Delta t}{\Delta x}-\frac{1}{2}\frac{\nu^2\Delta t^2+\sigma^2\Delta t}{\Delta x^2} 
\Leftrightarrow p_u=1+\frac{3}{2}\frac{\nu \Delta t}{\Delta x}+\frac{1}{2}\frac{\nu^2\Delta t^2+\sigma^2\Delta t}{\Delta x^2}．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore from the formula \eqref{ExForPb1},
\begin{eqnarray}
p_d=\frac{1}{2}(\frac{\nu^2\Delta t^2+\sigma^2\Delta t}{\Delta x^2}+\frac{\nu \Delta t}{\Delta x} ) 
=\frac{1}{2}( j^2M^2+\frac{1}{3}-jM) 
=\frac{1}{6}-\frac{j^2M^2-jM}{2}．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
p_m=-\frac{2\nu \Delta t}{\Delta x}-\frac{\nu^2\Delta t^2+\sigma^2\Delta t}{\Delta x^2} 
=2jM-(j^2M^2+\frac{1}{3}) 
=-\frac{1}{3}-j^2M^2+2jM．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
p_u=1+\frac{3}{2}\frac{\nu \Delta t}{\Delta x}+\frac{1}{2}\frac{\nu^2\Delta t^2+\sigma^2\Delta t}{\Delta x^2} 
=1+\frac{3}{2}(-jM)+\frac{1}{2}(j^2M^2+\frac{1}{3}) 
=\frac{7}{6}+\frac{j^2M^2-3jM}{2}．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the short rate process is introduced into the drift term $a_i$, which fluctuates with time. This drift term is chosen to be consistent with the discount bonds market quoted.
\begin{eqnarray}
P(0,i+1)=\int_{j=BottomNode[i]}^{TopNode[i]}Q_{i,j}e^{(-a_i+j\Delta r)\Delta t}．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, $Q_{i,j}$ is a security that pays $1$ when the node $(i,j)$ is reached, and pays nothing at other times.
Therefore, the drift term $ a_i $ is given as follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
\ln P(0,i+1)=\ln \int_{j=BottomNode[i]}^{TopNode[i]}Q_{i,j}e^{j\Delta r\Delta t}-a_i\Delta t 
\Leftrightarrow a_i\Delta t=\ln \int_{j=BottomNode[i]}^{TopNode[i]}Q_{i,j}e^{j\Delta r\Delta t}-\ln P(0,i+1) 
\Leftrightarrow a_i=\frac{\ln \int_{j=BottomNode[i]}^{TopNode[i]}Q_{i,j}e^{j\Delta r\Delta t}-\ln P(0,i+1)}{\Delta t}．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;derivation-of-black-scholes-pde-and-its-analytical-solution-by-arbitrage-pricing-theory&quot;&gt;Derivation of Black-Scholes PDE and its analytical solution by arbitrage pricing theory&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, when the underlying asset price is given by a stochastic differential equation, the price of the derivative product is given by a partial differential equation. In this paper, it will be derived from the Black-Scholes PDE corresponding to the derivative (here, option) price valuation of the underlying asset (here, stock) modeled as the geometric Brownian motion. The valuation of an option is given by determining the initial funding needed to fully hedge the selling position of the option. Since the determined initial fund is the amount required to build a duplicate portfolio, it is called the no arbitrage price at time zero of the option. The price valuation method that duplicates options in stock market and money market account transactions is called arbitrage pricing theory (APT).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose it is given a portfolio valued at $X(t)$ at any time $t$. Here, the composition of the given portfolio is as follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;money-market account with interest rate $r$&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A stock modeled by the geometric Brownian motion expressed by the following equation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}\label{stockPrice}
dS(t)=\alpha S(t)dt+\sigma S(t)dW(t)．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, it is assumed that the investor who holds the given portfolio holds the stock in the unit of $\Delta(t)$ at any time $t$. At this time, it is assumed that the number of shares held $\Delta(t)$ is an ‘adapted stochastic process’. The remainder of the portfolio excluding the investment in stocks, $X(t)-\Delta(t)S(t)$, is invested in the money market account.
Here, the small change $dX(t)$ of the portfolio value $X(t)$ at any time $t$ results in the following two factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Profit from holding shares $\Delta(t)dS(t)$&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Profit from holding cash $r(X(t)-\Delta(t)S(t))dt$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is, the small change in portfolio value $dX(t)$ is given by the following equation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}\label{portDiff}
dX(t)=\Delta(t)dS(t)+r(X(t)-\Delta(t)S(t))dt．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The equation \eqref{portDiff} is expanded as follows from the stochastic differential equation \eqref{stockPrice} of a given stock price.
\begin{eqnarray}\label{portDiff2}
dX(t)=\Delta(t)dS(t)+r(X(t)-\Delta(t)S(t))dt　
=\Delta(t)( \alpha S(t)dt+\sigma S(t)dW(t) )+r(X(t)-\Delta(t)S(t))dt
=rX(t)dt+\Delta(t)( \alpha -r )S(t)dt+\Delta(t)\sigma S(t)dW(t)．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, the three terms appearing in the small change $dX(t) in portfolio value $\eqref{portDiff2} expanded by the given stock price of the stochastic differential equation \eqref{stockPrice} can be interpreted as follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;$rX(t)dt$: A term that reflects the profit from the expected rate of return of the portfolio $r$&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;$\Delta(t)( \alpha -r )S(t)dt$: A term that reflects the risk premium on equity investments $\alpha-r$&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;$\Delta(t)\sigma S(t)dW(t)$: Volatility term proportional to the size of equity investment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, consider the discounted stock price $\mathrm{e}^{-rt} S(t)$ and the discounted portfolio value $\mathrm{e}^{-rt}X(t)$. In order to analyze these price processes, it should be noted that they are different from ordinary analysis due to the nature of the geometric Brownian motion that appeared as a model of stock prices. This property means that Brownian motion has a non-zero quadratic variation, which, as it will be seen later, is the source of the volatility term of the Black-Scholes PDE.
In other words, to differentiate an expression expressed in the form of $f(W(t))$ with $f(x)$ as a differentiable function and $W(t)$ as the Brown motion. If Brown motion $W(t)$ is differentiable, the following equation holds from ordinary analysis by the chain rule of the composite function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{d}{dt}f(W(t))=f’(W(t))W’(t) \Leftrightarrow df(W(t))=f’(W(t))W’(t)dt=f’(W(t))dW(t)．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, since Brownian motion accumulates a quadratic variation of 1 per unit time $(dWdW = dt)$, the derivative of $f(W(t))$ has a correction term shown in the following equation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}\label{ItoFormDiff}
df(W(t))=f’(W(t))dW(t)+\frac{1}{2}f’‘(W(t))dt．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The formula \eqref{ItoFormDiff} is called Ito’s formula in differential form. The equation \eqref{ItoFormDiff} is an equation obtained by differentiating Ito’s formula \eqref{ItoForm} for the Brownian motion shown below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ito’s formula for Brownian motion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Partial differentiation of $f(t, x)$, $f_ {t}(t, x)$, $f_{x}(t, x)$, $f_ {xx}(t, x)$ is defined and continuous. Let $W(t)$ be the Brownian motion. At this time, the following equation holds for all $T \geq0$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}\label{ItoForm}
f(T，W(T))=f(0，W(0))+\int_{0}^{T}f_{t}(t，W(t))dt+\int_{0}^{T}f_{x}(t，W(t))dW(t)+\frac{1}{2}\int_{0}^{T}f_{xx}(t，W(t))dt．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where the third term of the expression \eqref{ItoForm} $\int_{0}^{T}f_{x}(t, W(t)) dW(t)$ is called Ito integral, and the second and fourth terms are Lebesgue integrals for variables of time. Ito’s formula can be extended to general stochastic processes including the Brown process, excluding jump process. This stochastic process is called the Ito process $dX(t)=a(t)dW(t)+b(t)dt$, which accumulate the quadratic variation of $a^{2}(t)$ per unit time. It is assumed that $a(t)$ and $b(t)$ are adapted stochastic processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ito’s formula for the Ito process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let $X(t)$ be the Ito process, and $f(t, x)$ be the partial derivative $f_{t}(t, x)$, $f_{x}(t, x)$, $f_{xx}(t, x)$ be a defined and continuous function, and let $W(t)$ be Brownian motion. At this time, the following equation holds for all $T \geq 0$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}\label{ItoFormII}
f(T，X(T))=f(0，X(0))+\int_{0}^{T}f_{t}(t，X(t))dt+\int_{0}^{T}f_{x}(t，X(t))dX(t)+\frac{1}{2}\int_{0}^{T}f_{xx}(t，X(t))a^{2}(t)dt．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the derivative of the discounted stock price $\mathrm{e}^{-rt} S(t)$ is $f(t, x) = \mathrm{e}^{-rt} x$ which is gotten to apply Ito’s formula \eqref{ItoForm}. In the following, it is used that $f_{t} (t, x )=-r \mathrm{e}^{-rt} x$, $ f_{x}  (t, x )=\, mathrm{e}^{-rt}$, $f_{xx} (t, x )=0 $.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}\label{DiscountStockPrice}
d( \mathrm{e}^{-rt}S(t) )=df(t，S(t)) =f_{t}(t，S(t))dt+f_{x}(t，S(t))dS(t)+f_{xx}(t，S(t))dt=-r\mathrm{e}^{-rt}S(t)dt+\mathrm{e}^{-rt}dS(t) =-r\mathrm{e}^{-rt}S(t)dt+\mathrm{e}^{-rt}( \alpha S(t)dt+\sigma S(t)dW(t))=(\alpha-r)\mathrm{e}^{-rt}S(t)dt+\sigma\mathrm{e}^{-rt}S(t)dW(t)
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the derivative of the discounted portfolio value $\mathrm{e}^{-rt} X(t)$ is given by&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}\label{DiscountPort}
d( \mathrm{e}^{-rt}X(t) )=df(t，X(t))=f_{t}(t，X(t))dt+f_{x}(t，X(t))dX(t)+\frac{1}{2}f_{xx}(t，X(t))dt=-r\mathrm{e}^{-rt}X(t)dt+\mathrm{e}^{-rt}dX(t) =-r\mathrm{e}^{-rt}X(t)dt+\mathrm{e}^{-rt}( \Delta(t)dS(t)+r(X(t)-\Delta(t)S(t))dt)=\Delta(t)(\alpha-r)\mathrm{e}^{-rt}S(t)dt+\Delta(t)\sigma\mathrm{e}^{-rt}S(t)dW(t)=\Delta(t)d(\mathrm{e}^{-rt}S(t))．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this way, the formula \eqref{DiscountPort} is obtained by the discounted stock price $S(t)$ and the portfolio value $X(t)$ at the discount rate $\mathrm{e}^{-rt}$ with the interest rate $r$ of the money market account. The formula \eqref{DiscountPort} indicates that small change in the discount portfolio value $d(\mathrm{e}^{-rt}X(t))$ depends only on a small change in the discounted stock price $d(\mathrm{e}^{-rt}S(t))$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider a European call option where the payment on the maturity date $T$ is $(S(T)-K )^{+}$. Here, the strike price $K$ is assumed to be a non-negative constant.
Fischer Black, Myron Scholes and Robert Cox Merton argued that the value of European call option on maturity $T$ with payment $(S(T) -K )^{+}$ at any time $t$ depends on the length of time to maturity, the value of the stock price $S(t)$ at time $t$, the model parameters $r, \sigma$ and the strike price $K$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the model parameters $r, \sigma$ and the strike price $K$ are assumed to be constants, among the variables that affect the price evaluation of the European call option, only the time $t$ and the stock price $S(t)$ are  changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, according to the inference of Fischer Black et al, let the value of the European call option be $c(t, x)$ when the stock price is $S(t) = x$ at time $t$. Since the stock price $S(t)$ follows the stochastic differential equation \eqref{stockPrice}, the value of the European call option is also stochastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the value of the European call option is the stochastic process $c(t, S(t))$ obtained by replacing the stochastic process $S(t)$ with the parameter $x$. At the initial time, the future stock price $S(t)$ is unknown because it is probabilistic, then the value $c(t, S(t))$ of the future European call option is also unknown. Therefore, if the function $c(t, x)$ is determined, the value of the future European call option $c(t, S(t))$ is expressed by the future stock price $S(t)$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To duplicate a portfolio which does full hedge the option sell position, it is required to fit the value of the duplicate portfolio $X(t)$ at any time $t\in[0, T]$ in the value of future European call options $c(t, S(t))$ starting with a certain initial fund of $X(0)$ and investing in the stock market and money market accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The necessary and sufficient conditions for constructing this replication portfolio are $\ mathrm{e}^{-rt}X(t)=\mathrm{e}^{-rt} c(t, S (t))$ for any time $t \in[0, T]$. To show that the necessary and sufficient conditions are met,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}\label{IsCopyPort}
d(\mathrm{e}^{-rt}X(t))=d(\mathrm{e}^{-rt}c(t，S(t)))，t\in[0，T)
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And show that $X(0) = c(0, S(0))$ holds. In fact, the following equation is obtained by integrating the equation \eqref{IsCopyPort} from 0 to $t$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
\mathrm{e}^{-rt}X(t)-X(0)=\mathrm{e}^{-rt}c(t，S(t))-c(0，S(0))，t\in[0，T)
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this time, if $X(0)=c(0,S(0))$, then it is obtained the necessary and sufficient conditional expression $\mathrm{e}^{-rt}X(t)=\mathrm{e}^{-rt}c(t,S(t))$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;necessary-and-sufficient-condition-to-duplicate-the-portfolio-which-does-fully-hedge-the-option-sell-position&quot;&gt;Necessary and sufficient condition to duplicate the portfolio, which does fully hedge the option sell position&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To expand the right-hand side \eqref{IsCopyPort}, it is required to calculate the derivative of discount option price $\mathrm{e}^{-rt} c(t, S (t, S) t))$. To do this, it is needed to calculate the derivative of the option price $c(t, S(t))$. From Ito’s formula for the Ito process \eqref{ItoFormII} and the given stock price stochastic differential equation \eqref{stockPrice}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
dc(t，S(t))=c_{t}(t，S(t))dt+c_{x}(t，S(t))dS(t)+\frac{1}{2}c_{xx}(t，S(t))(\sigma S(t))^{2}dt=c_{t}(t，S(t))dt+c_{x}(t，S(t))( \alpha S(t)dt+\sigma S(t)dW(t) )+\frac{1}{2}c_{xx}(t，S(t))(\sigma S(t))^{2}dt=( c_{t}(t，S(t))dt+\alpha c_{x}(t，S(t))+\frac{1}{2}\sigma^{2} S^{2}(t)c_{xx}(t，S(t)))dt+\sigma S(t)c_{x}(t，S(t))dW(t)．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is calculated the derivative of discount option price $\mathrm{e}^{-rt} c (t)$ by Ito’s formula \eqref{ItoFormII} for the Ito process as $f(t, x)=\mathrm{e}^{-rt}x,S(t))$. In the following, it is used that $f_{t}(t,x)=-r\mathrm{e}^{-rt}x$, $f_{x}(t,x)=\mathrm{e}^{-rt}$, $f_{xx}(t,x)=0$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}\label{expandCallDis}
d(\mathrm{e}^{-rt}c(t，S(t)))=df(t，c(t，S(t)))=f_{t}(t，c(t，S(t)))dt+f_{x}(t，c(t，S(t)))dc(t，S(t))+\frac{1}{2}f_{xx}(t，c(t，S(t)) (\sigma S(t)c_{x}(t，S(t)))^{2}dt=-r\mathrm{e}^{-rt}c(t，S(t))+\mathrm{e}^{-rt} dc(t，S(t))=\mathrm{e}^{-rt}(-rc(t，S(t))+c_{t}(t，S(t))+\alpha c_{x}(t，S(t))+\frac{1}{2}\sigma^{2} S^{2}(t)c_{xx}(t，S(t)))dt+\mathrm{e}^{-rt}\sigma S(t)c_{x}(t，S(t))dW(t)．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is given the following equation to expand the right-hand side of \eqref{IsCopyPort} with the formula \eqref{expandCallDis} and the left-hand side with the formula \eqref{DiscountPort}.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}\label{expandCopyPort}
\Delta(t)(\alpha-r)S(t)dt+\Delta(t)\sigma S(t)dW(t)=( -rc(t，S(t))+c_{t}(t，S(t))+\alpha c_{x}(t，S(t))+\frac{1}{2}\sigma^{2} S^{2}(t)c_{xx}(t，S(t)))dt+\sigma S(t)c_{x}(t，S(t))dW(t)．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the expansion formula \eqref{expandCopyPort}, which is a necessary and sufficient condition for replicating a portfolio that completely hedges an option’s sell position, holds, the coefficients on both sides must be matched. Therefore, since the coefficients on both sides of $dW(t)$ are equal, the following equation is obtained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}\label{deltaHedging}
\Delta(t)=c_{x}(t，S(t))，t\in[0，T)
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of shares held to fully hedge the option’s sell position at any time $t$ before maturity is the partial derivative of the option value at time $t$ with respect to the stock price $c_{x}(t, S(t))$. The relational expression \eqref{deltaHedging} of $\Delta(t)$ is called the delta-hedging rule because it is called the optional delta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the coefficients on both sides of $dt$ are also equal, the following equation holds for any time $t\in[0, T)$ from the relational expression \eqref{deltaHedging} of $\Delta(t)$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}\label{expandCopyPortForT}
(\alpha-r)S(t)c_{x}(t，S(t))
=-rc(t，S(t))+c_{t}(t，S(t))+\alpha c_{x}(t，S(t))+\frac{1}{2}\sigma^{2} S^{2}(t)c_{xx}(t，S(t))
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since $\alpha c_{x}(t,S(t))$ term appears on both sides of the expression \eqref{expandCopyPortForT} for any time $t\in[0, T)$, it is obtained the following equation to extract this term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}\label{PreBlackScholes}
rc(t，S(t))=c_{t}(t，S(t))+rS(t)c_{x}(t，S(t))+\frac{1}{2}\sigma^{2} S^{2}(t)c_{xx}(t，S(t))
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, if the value of the European call option when the stock price is $S(t) = x$ at time $t$ is $c(t, x)$, then it is obtained the partial differential equation of Black-Scholes from the equation \eqref{PreBlackScholes}.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}\label{BlackScholes}
c_{t}(t，x)+rxc_{x}(t，x)\frac{1}{2}\sigma^{2} x^{2}c_{xx}(t，x)=rc(t，x)，t\in[0，T)，x\geq0
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to satisfying the equation \eqref{BlackScholes}, the function $c(t, x)$ must also satisfy the boundary conditions shown in the following equation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}\label{BoundaryCondtion}
c(T，x)=(x-K)^{+}，c(t，0)=0，\lim_{x \to \infty}[c(t，x)-(x-\mathrm{e}^{-r( T-t )}K)]=0
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the first equation of the expression \eqref{BoundaryCondtion} follows from the definition of the European call option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second equation is that when $x=0$ is substituted into the Black-Scholes partial differential equation \eqref{BlackScholes}, it is obtained the ordinary differential equation $c_{t}(t,0)=rc(t,0)$ for the function $c(t, 0)$ at time $t$ and then it is obtained its solution $c(t,0)=\mathrm{e}^{rt}$ is substituted $t=T$ for $c(0,0)$, which results in $c(T,0)=(0-K)^{+}=0$, $C(0,0)=0$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the third equation, ‘Put/Call Parity’ holds because it is likely to end with ‘In the money’ for European call options for very large $x$ and the value of the forward contract is almost equal to $x-\mathrm{e}^{-r (Tt )}K$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to obtain an analytical solution of the Black-Scholes PDE \eqref{BlackScholes}, it is reduced by change of variables to a PDE whose exact solution is known. Therefore, two variables $u$ and $v$ are defined by the following equation, which are introduced for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}\label{val1}
u=\log \frac{x}{K}+(r-\frac{\sigma^{2}}{2})(T-t) 
v=T-t
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, using the variables $u$ and $v$ defined in the expression \eqref{val1}, the function $c(t, x)$ is converted into two functions $\mathrm{e}^{-rv}$ and $y (u, v )$ as shown in the following expression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}\label{val2}
c(t，x)=\mathrm{e}^{-rv}y(u，v)．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Substituting the equation \eqref{val2} into the partial differential equation \eqref{BlackScholes} of Black-Scholes and rearranging it gives the following equation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}\label{HeatConductionEquation}
y_{u u}(u，v)-\frac{2}{\sigma^{2}}y_{v}(u，v)=0．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The equation \eqref{HeatConductionEquation} is a known partial differential equation with an exact solution called the heat conduction equation. Here, the boundary condition is changed by variable transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$c(t，x)=$
$x-K\cdots x\geq K$
$0\cdots x \lt K$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the following conditions have changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$y(u，0)=$
$K( \mathrm{e}^{u}-1 )\cdots u\geq 0$
$0\cdots u \lt 0$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is known that the heat conduction equation \eqref{HeatConductionEquation} is solved by the separation of variables method. The separation of variables method means that the solution $y(u,v)$ is expressed as the product of two functions $p(u)$ and $q(v)$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}\label{val3}
y(u，v)=p(u)q(v)．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Substituting the equation \eqref{val3} into the heat conduction equation \eqref{HeatConductionEquation} and rearranging it gives the following equation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}\label{SeparationVariables}
\frac{p_{u u}(u)}{p(u)}=\frac{2}{\sigma^{2}}\frac{q_{v}(v)}{q(v)}．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focusing on both sides of the obtained equation \eqref{SeparationVariables}, the left side is a function of only $u$ and the right side is a function of only $v$, then constants irrelevant to $u$ and $v$, which is $-k^{2}(0\leq k\lt \infty)$. Therefore, finding the solution of the heat conduction equation \eqref{HeatConductionEquation} results in the problem of solving the following two ordinary differential equations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;$\dfrac{p_{u u}(u)}{p(u)}=-k^{2}$&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;$\dfrac{2}{\sigma^{2}}\dfrac{q_{v}(v)}{q(v)}=-k^{2}$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first equation is a second-order ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients, then if the coefficients are constants $C(k)$ and $D(k)$ with respect to constants $k$ irrelevant to $u$ and $v$, the solution is given by the following equation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}\label{ODE1Sol}
p(u)=C(k)\sin( ku ) +D(k)\cos( ku ) ．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the second equation is a variable separable ordinary differential equation, if the coefficients are the constant $E(k)$ for the constant $k$ irrelevant to $u$ and $v$, the solution is given by the following equation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}\label{ODE2Sol}
q(v)=E(k)\exp( -\frac{\sigma^{2}k^{2}}{2}v ) ．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the solution $y (u, v )$ of the heat conduction equation \eqref{HeatConductionEquation} is a constant $k (0\leq k \lt \infty )$ irrelevant to $u$ and $v$. Then all are superposed to obtain the general solution shown in the following equation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}\label{HeatConductionEquationSol}
y(u，v)=\int_{0}^{+\infty}( C(k)\sin( ku ) +D(k)\cos( ku ) )\exp( -\frac{\sigma^{2}k^{2}}{2}v )dk．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, the coefficients $C(k)$ and $D(k)$ of the equation \eqref{HeatConductionEquationSol} are given by the following equation from Fourier’s integral theorem as $y(u,0)=g(a)$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}\label{FourierCoefficient}
C(k)=\frac{1}{\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}g(a)\cos (ka) da
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{eqnarray}\label{FourierCoefficient2}
D(k)=\frac{1}{\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}g(a)\sin (ka) da
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Substituting the obtained equation of coefficients \eqref{FourierCoefficient} and \eqref{FourierCoefficient2} into the solution \eqref{HeatConductionEquationSol} of the heat conduction equation \eqref{HeatConductionEquation} and rearranging it gives the following equation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}\label{HeatConductionEquationSol2}
y(u，v)=\dfrac{1}{\sigma \sqrt[]{\mathstrut 2 \pi v}} \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}g(a)\exp( -\dfrac{1}{2}(\dfrac{a-u}{\sigma \sqrt[]{\mathstrut v}})^{2} ) da．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For further analysis, the change of variables is performed again as follows. 
\begin{eqnarray}\label{}
w=\dfrac{a-u}{\sigma \sqrt[]{\mathstrut v}}．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the boundary conditions have changed to the following conditions due to the change of variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$g(a)=g( u+\sigma \sqrt[]{\mathstrut v}w )=$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$K( \mathrm{e}^{u+\sigma \sqrt[]{\mathstrut v}w}-1 )\cdots w\geq -\dfrac{u}{\sigma \sqrt[]{\mathstrut v}}$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or $0\cdots w \lt -\dfrac{u}{\sigma \sqrt[]{\mathstrut v}}$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focusing on the change of variables by $w$ and the changed boundary conditions, the equation \eqref{HeatConductionEquationSol2} is expanded as follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}\label{HeatConductionEquationSol3}
y(u，v)=\dfrac{1}{\sqrt[]{\mathstrut 2 \pi}} \int_{-\dfrac{u}{\sigma \sqrt[]{\mathstrut v}}}^{+\infty}K( \exp(u+\sigma \sqrt[]{\mathstrut v}w)-1 )\exp( -\dfrac{w^{2}}{2} )dw
=\dfrac{1}{\sqrt[]{\mathstrut 2 \pi}} \int_{-\frac{u}{\sigma \sqrt[]{\mathstrut v}}}^{+\infty}K\exp(u+\sigma \sqrt[]{\mathstrut v}w-\dfrac{w^{2}}{2}) dw-\dfrac{1}{\sqrt[]{\mathstrut 2 \pi}} \int_{-\frac{u}{\sigma \sqrt[]{\mathstrut v}}}^{+\infty} K \exp(-\dfrac{w^{2}}{2})dw．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, if the first term on the right side of the equation \eqref{HeatConductionEquationSol3} is replaced with $z = w- \sigma \sqrt[]{\mathstrut v}$ and the second term is replaced with $z = w$, the following equation is obtained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}\label{HeatConductionEquationSol4}
y(u，v)=x\exp(rv) \dfrac{1}{ \sqrt[]{\mathstrut 2 \pi}} \int_{-\frac{u}{\sigma \sqrt[]{\mathstrut v}}^{+\infty}-\sigma \sqrt[]{\mathstrut v}}\exp( -\dfrac{z^{2}}{2} ) dz-K\dfrac{1}{ \sqrt[]{\mathstrut 2 \pi}} \int_{-\frac{u}{\sigma \sqrt[]{\mathstrut v}}}^{+\infty}\exp( -\dfrac{z^{2}}{2} ) dz
=x\exp(rv)N(\frac{u}{\sigma \sqrt[]{\mathstrut v}}+\sigma \sqrt[]{\mathstrut v})-KN( \frac{u}{\sigma \sqrt[]{\mathstrut v}})．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, by substituting the obtained equation \eqref{HeatConductionEquationSol4} into the solution of the Black-Scholes PDE \eqref{val2} is obtained as an analytical solution of the Black-Scholes PDE, which is a function that satisfies the Black-Scholes PDE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}\label
c(t，x)=xN(\frac{u}{\sigma \sqrt[]{\mathstrut v}} + \sigma \sqrt[]{\mathstrut v} ) -K \exp(-rv)N(\frac{u}{\sigma \sqrt[]{\mathstrut v}})
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$u=\log \frac{x}{K}+(r-\frac{\sigma^{2}}{2})(T-t)$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$v=T-t$&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;derivation-of-yield-curve-construction-formula-with-tenor-basis-spread&quot;&gt;Derivation of yield curve construction formula with tenor basis spread&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If LIBOR is truly risk-free, the swap of 3-month LIBOR and 6-month LIBOR should be tradable with zero spread. However, LIBOR takes into account the credit risk of banks, and tenor swaps are exactly the transactions that swap the risk of 3-month LIBOR and 6-month LIBOR. After the financial crisis, the risk of bankruptcy, that is, the difference in tenor, was conscious, and when swap 3-month LIBOR and 6-month LIBOR, the 3-month LIBOR side began to trade with a non-negligible spread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, after supplementing the discount factor and tenor spread in 0.25 year increments, the future 3-month LIBOR can be calculated as follows (Nakahara, 2013).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
L_{forward}^{3MWorld}(t,t_{i},t_{i+0.25})=\frac{1-DF(t,t_{i+0.25})-TS^{3M-6M}(t,t_{i+0.25})\times\sum_{j=1}^{4i+1}{DF(t,t_{\frac{j}{4}})\times\frac{1}{4}}}{DF(t,t_{i+0.25})\times\frac{1}{4}}+\frac{-\sum_{j=1}^{4i}{L_{forward}^{3MWorld}(t,t_{\frac{j-1}{4}},t_{\frac{j}{4}})\times DF(t,t_{\frac{j}{4}})\times\frac{1}{4}}}{DF(t,t_{i+0.25})\times\frac{1}{4}}．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;$L(t,T)$: Observable LIBOR at time point $t$ maturity $T$&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;$L_{forward}^{3MWorld}(t,t_{0},t_{0.25})=L(t,t_{0.25})$&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;$L_{forward}^{3MWorld}(t,t_{i},t_{i+0.25})$: A 3-month LIBOR with a reset date of $t_{i}$ and a maturity of $t_{i+0.25}$ as seen from the point in time $t$&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;$TS^{3M-6M}(t,T)$: Tenor spread when swapping 6-month LIBOR for 3-month LIBOR at time $t$ and maturity $T$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we try to derive the equation (1). 
At this time, the evaluation formula of the JPY tenor swap is expressed as follows (Takahashi, 2010)．&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
\sum_{n=1}^{N}\delta_{n}(E_{t}[L(T_{n-1},T_{n}+\tau_{N}]P_{t,T_{n}})=\sum_{m=1}^{M}\delta_{m}E_{t}[L(T_{m-1},T_{m}]P_{t,T_{m}}．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;$N=2M$&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;$L(T_{n-1},T_{n})$: LIBOR with a reset date of $T_{n-1}$ and a maturity of $T_{n}$&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;$P_{t,T_{n}}$: Zero coupon bond price with maturity of $t$ at time $ T_{n}$&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;$\delta_{n}$: Interest calculation period&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;$\tau_{N}$: Tenor spread when swapping 6-month LIBOR for 3-month LIBOR at time $t$ and maturity of $T (= T_{N} = T_{M})$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we want to derive 3 months LIBOR, that is, $E_{t}[L(T_{N-1}, T_{N}]$, therefore expand the left side of the expression (2) as follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
\sum_{n=1}^{N}\delta_{n}(E_{t}[L(T_{n-1},T_{n}+\tau_{N}]P_{t,T_{n}})=\sum_{n=1}^{N-1}\delta_{n}(E_{t}[L(T_{n-1},T_{n})]P_{t,T_{n}}+\delta_{N}E_{t}[L(T_{N-1},T_{N})]P_{t,T_{N}}+\sum_{n=1}^{N}\delta_{n}\tau_{N}P_{t,T_{n}}．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the relationship between Libor and the discount rate is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
E_{t}[L(T_{m-1},T_{m})]=\frac{1}{\delta_{n}}\left(\frac{P_{t,T_{m-1}}}{P_{t,T_{n}}}-1\right)．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since it is represented by, the left side of the expression \label{tenor} can be expanded as follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
\sum_{m=1}^{M}\delta_{m}E_{t}[L(T_{m-1},T_{m}]P_{t,T_{m}}=P_{t,T_{0}}-P_{t,T_{M}}=1-P_{t,T_{M}}．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, JPY 3 months LIBOR, ie $E_{t} [L(T_{N-1},T_{N}]$, is given below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
E_{t}[L(T_{N-1},T_{N}]=\frac{1-P_{t,T_{M}}-\sum_{n=1}^{N}\delta_{n}\tau_{N}P_{t,T_{n}}}{\delta_{N}P_{t,T_{N}}}+\frac{-\sum_{n=1}^{N-1}\delta_{n}(E_{t}[L(T_{n-1},T_{n})]P_{t,T_{n}}}{\delta_{N}P_{t,T_{N}}}．
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;venture-capital-finance&quot;&gt;Venture capital finance&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venture capital (VC) plays a significant role for the national economy.  This is primarily because although total VC investment was only less than 0.2% of GDP of the United States, VC backed firms generated 11% of all private sector jobs and earned annual revenues which was equal to 21% of GDP (Thiel, 2014).  In addition, unlike general financial intermediaries such as bank finance, VC do focus on their managerial resources not only money but also expertise to certain industries including software (22% of their total investment) and biotechnology (17% of that) (Bettignies, James and Brander, 2006).  This may mean that VC believe their effort and resources deeply affect the start-ups invested by them.  However, it is disputed that what kind factors influence the performance of the VC backed firms.  In fact, some researchers asserted that agency problems and low ability might be much less detrimental than VC backed start-ups of the dyad-partner’s sentiments of injustice, unfairness and lack of trust and therefore these feelings could be a decisive obstacle to value-creation and success in the ones.  This essay will evaluate the argument in terms of venture capital theory, standard economic one and behavioral economics ones including social preferences with these evidences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;agency-problem-and-its-influence-of-the-start-ups-performance&quot;&gt;Agency problem and its influence of the start-up’s performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the agency theory, there is an agency problem between the venture capitalists as a principal and the entrepreneurs as an agent who are assured fully self-interested and therefore their interest would be conflicted in a certain situation (UTSET, 2002).  One of the major examples for the agency problem is adverse selection (ibid).  There are good and bad entrepreneurs, however, the bad one may be able to pretend as if the good one and hence, the venture capitalists have to be able to distinguish between them (ibid).  Therefore, if the venture capitalist invests in a bad entrepreneur who had low ability or even high one but low motivation, the performance of the start-up might be deteriorated.  In addition, the hold-up risk is also the vital example of the agency problem.  The risk is that the entrepreneur can be imperil to abandon making an effort to improve the performance of his firm invested by VC till the venture capitalist reconsiders how to divide the proportion of equity distribution (ibid).  Although they can protect in the region of hold-up risk using wide range provisions, still the protection measures might be incomplete due to their inability (ibid).  Moreover, the entrepreneur might behave as if their performance is better than it actually is to induce to overestimate and be invested by venture capitalist, which is called window dressing (Burchardt et al, 2016).  This is also one of the most important phenomena caused by agency problems.  Therefore, the entrepreneur tends to focus on the short-term performance, even if they may lose the long term one.  Besides, due to the lack of ability to monitor and manage the performance, either or both of the entrepreneur and the venture capitalist may free ride others and exploit their effort, which is one of classic agency problems called free rider problem (ROMANS, 2013).  Hence, the performance could be deteriorated if some of the stakeholders attempted to free ride others.  Furthermore, if there is a loophole of the investment contract but the one is one of the key factor to improve higher performance, the entrepreneur’ effort in the loophole may be unobservable for VC and then the entrepreneur tend to omit the key activities in the one, which is defined as moral hazard (TUCKER, 2004).  Thus, the prevention to ignore the key performance factors related activities in the contract can be important for the performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dyad-partners-sentiments-and-these-influence-of-the-start-ups-performance&quot;&gt;Dyad-partner’s sentiments and these influence of the start-up’s performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other factors to affect the performance are their emotions such as justice, fair and trust.  Even if the venture capitalist selects a good entrepreneur who wants to manage the team, still running them is a difficult issue.  For instance, some researchers argued that the perceived justice of equity distribution on entrepreneurial teams play a role for their performance (Breugst, Patzelt and Rathgeber, 2014).  High perceived distributive justice causes mutual, constructive team synergy spirals, on the other hand, low one provokes unfavorable team interactions spirals and the ones further decrease perceived justice of equity distribution (ibid).  This is because if their contract according to equity distribution is not perceived as fair, it seems to be that the evolution of intrateam trust is acutely damaged (ibid).  In addition, it is demonstrated that as the entrepreneur feels greater fairness, VC tend to offer the equity higher and therefore, the entrepreneur might make a higher value-adding effort (Fairchild, 2010).  This can be because the higher commitment to decisions, performance, behavior and attitude might be led by the increase in the perception of fairness of entrepreneurs (ibid).  Furthermore, Harrison (1999 cited in TUCKER, 2004) claimed that the lack of trust between the entrepreneur and the venture capitalist may enlarge the risk which the start-up might not be lucrative.  This is mainly because less able venture capitalists incline to require punitive covenants to assure themselves against the danger of inconvenience performance, which is caused by their limited ability to bring an amending control to a downside condition (ibid).  Also, there is a tendency that each player prefers to distribute at least the same amount as the volume that the other players earn, which is called envy-freeness (Brams, 2005).  It can be vital for the performance because if they reach envy-free distribution, no one may envy others, which means it is less likely to be the negative actions against the team.  What is more, Empathy is defined as the feeling intimately linked to mutual trust between the entrepreneur and VC (Fairchild, 2009).  It is suggested that the degree of the entrepreneur-VC empathy corresponding to the value-adding abilities of VC altered the entrepreneur’s selection of financier and the arising value of the VC and also argued that if the entrepreneur felt higher empathy for the VC with lower value-adding ability, the entrepreneur might select the lower ability VC rather than higher one and hence the performance of the firm would be decreased (ibid).  This may mean that the performance of the empathically biased entrepreneur tends to be lower than the performance of the unbiased one.  Additionally, it is asserted that if the entrepreneur has the overconfidence and unrealistic optimism, they may ignore some important figures and signs which is against their buoyant forecast and therefore they might serve to induce their miscalculation of the possibility of new venture failure linked to the potential investors of their company control who are less overconfident (Douglas, Carlsson-Wall and Hjelström, 2014).  This is because although the probability of the company that consequently fail might be calculated as an objective measure of the default probability if they are in high competitive market, if the entrepreneur and their firm having a new service enter to a new market which has a few competitors or no completion, the probability of failure must be estimated subjectively based on their unrealistic point of view and unfeasible forecast (ibid).  Hence, the overconfidence of the entrepreneur might deteriorate the performance of the start-ups due to unfeasible forecasts induced by their overconfidence.  Correspondingly, some researchers indicated that the over-optimistic entrepreneurs interpret transactional facts hypothetically that understates consequent risks, which they fail to invest in collecting transactional-specific information and tend to enter transactions without consultation of the external advisors. (UTSET, 2002).  Therefore, over-optimism may induce an entrepreneur to participate in the contracts which do not count on the actual risks that the start-ups may suffer (ibid).  Even if the over-optimistic entrepreneur completely comprehends the arduous arrangements in a venture capital contract, they would not be certainly concerned, assuming such events which would cause these adverse agreements will not be realized (ibid).  However, during the cycle of the start-up, when unfavorable cases of the planet induce demanding provisions in VC contracts, the initial over-optimistic expectations of the entrepreneur will introduce blunt facts relative to the real nature of the proper conditions (ibid).  Thus, the over-optimism of the entrepreneur might affect their performance due to unfeasible contracts agreed with VC.  This is because they may not prepare unpreferable situations which are likely to happen.  Finally, looking at negative feelings, such sentiment may lead to revenge for the company and then the performance of the one could be declined (UTSET, 2002).  This is because the angered player such as an employee might be ready to commit in active sabotage or to deliver indirect actions including not employing enough effort, even if the explicit profits of doing so seem to be less than the expenses (ibid).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;comparison-between-standard-economic-and-behavioral-theory&quot;&gt;Comparison between standard economic and behavioral theory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the feasible tools to analyze the economic and social situation is game theory.  For instance, as a result of game theory which is assured the players are fully rational, they might reach the equilibrium to avoid the conflictions mainly caused by the agency problem above such as adverse selection, hold-up risk, window dressing, free rider problem and moral hazard (Fairchild and Yao, 2017).  The equilibrium might say that all rational venture capitalists ought to fairly suggest 43% of the equity to the entrepreneur, holding 57% themselves, and all of the players in the dyad should exert their power (ibid).  On the other hand, after counting on the emotion of the entrepreneur and the venture capitalist such as fairness, empathy and engagement among the duo, the equilibrium is moved and then reached a new one which is relatively balanced (almost 50/50) (ibid).  This can mean in general, the venture capitalists may be superior to the entrepreneurs mainly due to their expertise, such advantage might not affect to improve performance in the long run because of their sentiments and therefore, both of them can consider this emotional effect to the equity distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This essay has assessed the argument that a crucial barrier to value-creation and success in VC backed prospective start-ups is that of the dyad-partners’ sentiments which can be furthermore detrimental than agency problems and low ability.  To this end, it has discussed the effects of agency problems and Dyad-partner’s sentiments for the performance, and also the comparison between standard economic and behavioral theory relative to both aspects.  It is concluded that agency problems might induce mainly moral hazard, hold-up risk, free-riding and window dressing, which could decline the performance.  Also, Dyad-partner’s sentiments are primary injustice, unfairness. lack of trust, envy, empathy, overconfident and negative reciprocity (revenge), which might deteriorate the performance and therefore emotionally biased the entrepreneur tend to be lower performer than unbiased one.  In addition, the major difference between standard economic and behavioral theory can be typically observed in the equilibrium of the equity distribution in dyad partners.  The emotion of the entrepreneur might require more equal amount of the equity even if they recognize asymmetry information with VC and thus the difference might be the premium for any type of counter actions against unfairness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a modified version of the report for Strategic brand management in Bath Full Time MBA Class of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;strategic-brand-management&quot;&gt;Strategic brand management&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In-store purchasing process can be one of the most significant parts among all kinds of processes including online.   This is primary because retail market is the largest industry in the all category of the industries such as automobile and it still keeps to grow the sales, for example, the revenue of the world largest retailer (WalMart) doubles in size every five years, which is more than 2 times larger than Amazon (the top online retailer in the world).  In fact, only one square meter of sales space can earn 80.000.000 US dollars per year.  Therefore, the retailers still are vitally important as a major channel and therefore the research of that is advancing rapidly.  On the other hand, an online retailer is building its physical one and vice versa then ‘online merge offline’ might be going faster.  To combine in-store marketing with online one, this essay will discuss how to build the brand online to use the online trading platform as an example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;##Future Work
For the purpose of this essay, it is considered how to build a brand for selling a certain product via landing page on the web.  More specifically, the product assumed the commission-free investing online platform which can be the alternative of Robinhood.  The user can invest in most financial products such as stocks and forex after creating their account without no or a few commissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;segmentation-targeting-and-positioning&quot;&gt;Segmentation, Targeting and Positioning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, from the marketing viewpoint, it should be focused on a specific customer segment.  Generation C can be consistent with the purpose as a target customer.  This is primary because they have two main features which are young (born between 1982 and 1996) and tech-savvy that means they relate to each other via social media such as YouTube and Facebook (PICKETT, 2019).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;four-es-as-an-alternative-marketing-mix-4-ps&quot;&gt;Four Es as an Alternative Marketing mix 4 Ps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 Ps stand for product, price, place and promotion, on the other hand, 4 Es do so experience, exchange, everywhere and evangelism &lt;cite&gt;(Poulou, 2018)&lt;/cite&gt;.  This is due to the customers wanting a certain experience from the service, rather than just consuming the product (ibid).  In addition, some contemporary businesses provide its service for them without any charges and then instead of the fee, it sells the data of them and advertising space (ibid).  Furthermore, most customers connect to the Internet mainly via mobile phone and therefore, they can buy the product everywhere (ibid).  Moreover, although traditional advertising such as TV commercials is still important, customer evangelists are also becoming a significant factor to sell the products due to the huge social media networks (ibid).  Therefore, it is primary important to consider how to advertise the product via influencers.  For instance, the young famous venture capitalists and investors can play the key role for the product advertising in this essay and operation costs can be compensated by sales of data instead of commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;two-systems-of-thinking&quot;&gt;Two Systems of Thinking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also important to analyze how the customer, especially the target one, thinks about the product.  According to Kahneman (2012), people have two different systems of thinking processes which are called system 1 and system 2.  Former administers automatically and immediately with little or no effort and no space to be worked by voluntary control (ibid).  The latter, on the other hand, assigns attention to the arduous mental activities which require it such as complicated computations (ibid).  Hence, the purchasing process can be mainly related to unconscious thinking.  It is supported by the fact that its brand can have the biggest influence in the purchasing decision primary because in certain type of products, for example, top 10 brands of beer dominated more than 70 % of total share of the United States beer sales in 2002 &lt;cite&gt;(Corstjens and Steele, 2008)&lt;/cite&gt;.  It can be also supported by the eye tracking observations.  This is because the subjects of the eye tracking experiment seems to have quite narrow eye sight which only focus on the middle and low of goods shelves and their decision making tend to be relatively quick (a few second), which may mean they decide to buy the goods unconsciously based on the limited information such as price and brand &lt;cite&gt;(Nordfält, 2020)&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;customer-decision-journey&quot;&gt;Customer Decision Journey&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best methods to monitor the progress can be retention rate to purchase a target product (or service).  This is mainly because the first trial of the product could be driven by the marketing and sales activities such as discounting and up (cross) selling, not purely the intrinsic value of the one and therefore, the purchase after trial can be expected to mitigate the effect of sales and marketing.  The decision process journey can be divided to the four cycles which are initial consideration, active evaluation, closure and post purchase &lt;cite&gt;(Court et al., 2009)&lt;/cite&gt;.  In the post purchase, it is assumed that the customer builds the expectation of the bought product and hence they will decide if they repurchase the one, which is called ‘loyalty loop’ (ibid).  Thus, retention rate might be estimated to monitor loyalty loop .  Hence, the brand discussed in this essay should be to strengthen the loyalty loop which can be monitored by retention rate, which means the brand can be said to be associated with a product category (for instance, an online investment platform) when the customer purchases the service in brands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;brand-association-map&quot;&gt;Brand Association Map&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, a brand association map is a strategic, comprehensive framework which can provide the implication its brand has vis‐à‐vis main competitors &lt;cite&gt;(Till, Baack and Waterman, 2011)&lt;/cite&gt;.  The maps describe a brand and its associations besides an evaluation of the strength, relevance, uniqueness and favorability of each association (ibid).  In addition, a strong brand has stronger and more intensive association (strength and relevance), larger positive futures (favorability) and sharper distinct futures within the product category (uniqueness).  The map can be built by the customer experience (CX) including pre and post purchase one.  Therefore, sales and marketing strategy of the product should be focused on increasing the four points (strength, relevance, uniqueness and favorability).  One of the major examples of increasing its brand value  can be HSBC, the board of which developed its audited brand value from nearly zero in 1999 to $10 billion in 2005 to send the customers the message which is ‘the world’s local bank’ &lt;cite&gt;(Beverland, 2018)&lt;/cite&gt;.  In fact, its logo (hexagon) can be associated with banks and icons in advertising shows the respect for cultural difference. For example, the symbol of tea in China is different from Turkey (ibid).  Therefore, the landing page of the product in this essay, especially its design should be changed by the visitor’s attributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;search-engine-optimization&quot;&gt;Search Engine Optimization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The customer can buy the product everywhere, however, the entrance of the Internet seems to be dominated by only a few search engines such as Google and YouTube.  Hence, it is inevitable to find how to optimize the engines, one of the most fundamental strategies of which can be maximize the number of links.  This is mainly because there is a stable relationship in correlation between links and ranking from 2007 to 2020 and high correlation between authoritative links and ranking &lt;cite&gt;(Nordfält, 2020)&lt;/cite&gt;.  Thus, the landing page of the product in this essay needs the links to be searched by the target customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This essay has discussed how to build the brand on the web using the online trading platform as an example.  The target segment decided Gen C and then the evangelists did so young VCs and investors.  The logo of the product should be a simple and single icon, however, advertising for it and the landing page should be varied by customer attributions.  Also, the landing page should optimize the search engines to increase the number of the links.  Finally, these experiments should be monitored by the retention rate which is the equivalent of a loyalty loop in the customer decision journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a modified version of the report for Understanding Finance (Part 2: Sources of finance) in Bath Full Time MBA Class of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;sources-of-finance&quot;&gt;Sources of finance&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This report will address three issues, one of which is to identify and explain three factors that a Chief Financial Officer (CFO) have consider to determine an appropriate source of finance for a company, which are mainly how much to pay dividends from retained earnings and the level of gearing with debt and equity.  Another problem is to explain why debt is usually a cheaper source of finance than equity is true owing to tax deductibility and lower cost.  The last topic is to describe the two sources of funding (revolving credit facility and senior note), explaining how each source of funding works and outlining at least one advantage and one disadvantage of each source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;appropriate-source-of-finance&quot;&gt;Appropriate source of finance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sources of finance for a company are mainly retained earnings, equity and debt.  When a Chief Financial Officer (CFO) considers a harmony of these sources, they should think how much they should return the retained earnings as the dividends for their shareholders primarily.  This is mainly because Assets of investors should be allocated by the most productive way, therefore, usually the retained earnings, consequently dividends ought to be reinvested to other more the companies or projects except for some cases including Google with zero dividend policy owing to having a great deal of cash generating projects internally.  However, even if the company has some projects with a positive NPV, it may not be covered by only their retained earnings.  In this situation, CFO should consider how to finance at the lowest cost, especially interest to gear with equity and debt, which are external sources for the company.  There are two theories to find an optimal capital structure, which are pecking order theory and trade off theory, however, both argued that debt is better or more preferable than equity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-reason-debt-is-usually-a-cheaper-source-of-finance-than-equity&quot;&gt;The reason debt is usually a cheaper source of finance than equity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;why debt is usually a cheaper source of finance than equity can be mainly two reasons.  One of them is that the cost of debt is less than the cost of equity due to lower risk.  Although the issuer has to pay the arrangement fee when they issue the debt, still the cost is cheaper than the one of equity because they must pay the dividend unless they have no dividend policy.  Another reason might be that the debt interest is tax deductible which lowers cost to the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-sources-of-funding-revolving-credit-facility-and-senior-note&quot;&gt;The sources of funding (revolving credit facility and senior note)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is funded by debt mainly including revolving credit facility and senior note.  A revolving credit (facility) is a modified line of credit which is a one-time agreement due to the fact that the account is closed when the company spends the maximum amount previously determined &lt;cite&gt;(Segal, 2019)&lt;/cite&gt;.  However, the difference between a revolving credit and normal one is that the company can pay on a revolving credit account regularly with slightly higher interest rate which can be the one of major disadvantages.  On the other hand, one of the major advantages might be that the company has the capability to pay on demand, which is equal to having the liquidity to pay by cash even if the company has no cash.
The senior note is a debt to have a right to be paid by the issuer primarily when they are bankrupt in comparison with the subordinate debt &lt;cite&gt;(Watson and Head, 2019)&lt;/cite&gt;.  The primary claim on an issuer’s assets and tax-deductible can be the major advantages.  In contrast, one of the disadvantages might be that the issuer has to be redeemed when it reaches maturity.  In addition, according to the tradeoff theory, the debt increases financial risk because the interest has to be paid primary and therefore the dividend may not remain.  As a result, a senior note which has a higher interest than the normal one can increase the risk of bankruptcy more than using ordinary debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Y Combinator (YC) can be one of the most popular venture capital (VC) in the world.  One of the main reasons for popularity might be they ‘created a new model for funding early stage startups’ &lt;cite&gt;(Y Combinator, 2020)&lt;/cite&gt;.  This is because for only 15 years since 2005, they have supported more than 2,000 firms including Airbnb, Dropbox and Heroku, which are valued beyond 100 billion dollars (ibid).  They also have Startup School which is a free 8-week online course for building startups. In addition, Hacker News which is one of the most famous social news sites in the world.  Therefore, they might have a total ecosystem about startups which is not only for investors such as themselves but also for the people who are going to become founders.  In addition, VC can be one of the most apparent knowledge intensive industries and YC is one of the biggest winners of the VC industry, especially early stage startups fund raising.  This essay will appraise the effectiveness of this firm’s current knowledge management practices and acknowledge what requires to be done to enhance both formal and informal knowledge management practices in terms of six aspects in relation to YC.  These aspects are earned to address the definition of knowledge currently used in YC, whether this definition reflects the complexity of knowledge in YC, whether the core knowledge management enablers are in YC, what are the core knowledge assets in YC, The current knowledge management practices and what can be done to effectively match knowledge assets and knowledge management practices? respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-definition-of-knowledge-currently-used-in-the-organization&quot;&gt;The definition of knowledge currently used in the organization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YC provides the program for the company, mainly startup founders who want to present and get feedback on their ideas or business plans for the investors and YC alumni &lt;cite&gt;(Moed, 2019)&lt;/cite&gt;.  The knowledge which YC share with the founders experienced this program is mainly instruction how to create a startup effectively and how to avoid the danger of starting up (ibid).  One of the most popular example of startup knowledge can be the statement that the founders should not scale or raise the money by the funds before they found Product Market Fit (PMF) because if they did not find PMF, although they burn a huge amount of cash, the revenue would not increase owing to the fact that the customers just do not want to buy their product and therefore whether the product which the founders built seems to be PMF or not can be the most significant factor as for the VC including YC themselves &lt;cite&gt;(Seibel, 2016)&lt;/cite&gt;.  However, VCs even the greatest one are always losing the opportunity to invest the prospective startups which other VC recommended to invest together mainly because the investor in the VC had to convince other partners in their firms and this might be extremely time consuming and difficult task owing to the fact that no one can see the future but they must predict what the firm will become &lt;cite&gt;(Graham, 2011)&lt;/cite&gt;.  PMF is vitally important to decide whether the VCs invest in the startups or not. This is primary because according to CB Insights, 42% of startups failed due to the fact that they built the product which the customers do not need &lt;cite&gt;(Griffin, 2017)&lt;/cite&gt;.  Despite the importance, there are several definitions of PMF.  The space to interpret the PMF might create the complexity and difficulty to manage the startups.  However, survey.io provides the startups one of the most widespread PMF survey tools named and developed by Sean Ellis &lt;cite&gt;(Shah, 2020)&lt;/cite&gt;.  The survey asks the customers the question which is ‘How would you feel if you could no longer use their product?’ with choices which are ‘Very disappointed’, ‘Somewhat disappointed’ or ‘Not disappointed (It really isn’t that useful)’ and as a result of this survey, According to Sean Ellis, if at least 40% of people who are surveyed selected ‘Very disappointed’, the product would reach PMF (ibid).  Slack earned 51% respondents who opted ‘Very disappointed’ if it no longer existed and therefore it is already being utilized by more than 750,000 people per day (ibid).  This case is one of the most apparent examples of the product which reached PMF.  As for the most VCs especially in the United States, PMF is the fundamental condition to invest and therefore they want to know whether the startup’s service truly reaches PMF or not, however, this knowledge which YC and other VCs address still exists ambiguously.  From a contemporary view, the knowledge characterized several aspects such as being partial (which means no one can write fully all of ideas people have), tacit (the gap between the idea and the ability to write it), subjective, and context dependent &lt;cite&gt;(Hislop et al, 2018)&lt;/cite&gt;.  Hence, PMF can be a typical case of modern characteristic knowledge as for the investors and founders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whether-this-definition-reflects-the-complexity-of-knowledge-in-the-organization&quot;&gt;Whether this definition reflects the complexity of knowledge in the organization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is clearly positively affected on strengthening YC’s competitive advantages compared with other VCs.  This can be because they are expanding their community members as YC alumni and becoming the authority to give the startup the credit for the future scaling mainly due to the fact that they could find Airbnb and Dropbox which are one of the most valuable firms in the world before they succeeded and therefore it can be easily imagine if a startup rose money by YC, the firm would be believed as a next Airbnb by the investors and consumers.  From the viewpoint of the learning organization (LO) which is defined as ‘organization which facilitates the learning of all its members and consciously transforms itself and its context’ , YC can be also the example of LO, however, they not only facilitate the stuff in the firm but also the member of their community outside of the company &lt;cite&gt;(Hislop et al, 2018)&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whether-the-core-knowledge-management-enablers-are-in-place&quot;&gt;Whether the core knowledge management enablers are in place&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Graham who is the cofounder of YC and the author of some popular books in the software engineering industry could be the core knowledge management enablers.  His blog can be the one of the most famous and authorized.  In addition, the blog mainly is written about IT and Startups.  Among his posts in blog, the article named ‘Subject: Airbnb’ might be the most popular one, which is written about Fred Wilson, the famous investor, who was missing Airbnb and posted the actual emails about that &lt;cite&gt;(Graham, 2011)&lt;/cite&gt;.  He tried to translate the tacit knowledge which only few successful investors knew about investment decision making into an explicit one to write the article and show real email conversation.  Although still some knowledge which he could not write is there, this experiment can represent his and his VC’s character for knowledge management and its process.  Another main source of the core knowledge management enablers also could be the startup founders who joined YC programs.  The lecturers in the programs are mainly the co-founders and the partners of the firm, however, some of them are YC backed startup founders who used to be students in this program.  The winners, who could raise money and other resources such as the knowledge about startup management, also become the lecturer or at least guest speaker in the program.  Even if the students do not become such a person, they can communicate and teach each other in the social networking site which are provided by YC as a platform and they can meet other students who are struggling to run their own startup online using Skype, Google Hangout or other Online video communication tools in a certain period, for example, the typical program has 8 weeks and therefore usually they can communicate each other with the lecturer on week 2, 4, 6 and 8.  Other major sources of the core knowledge management enablers could be the location and culture where YC is located, Silicon Valley in San Francisco of California.  This is mainly because this place is one of the most intensively high tech companies and VC located in the area and therefore the founders can easily meet their customers and find their mentors who have already succeeded in the similar business to learn how to do what they truly want to do &lt;cite&gt;(Migicovsky, 2019)&lt;/cite&gt;.  In addition, Silicon Valley can be characterized mainly by 2 features, which are respecting ‘wild’ ideas and paying forward &lt;cite&gt;(Jordan, 2017)&lt;/cite&gt;.  Only in this area, the ideas which people living in the outside of this cultural context may insult are accepted and encouraged owing to the fact that the people in Silicon Valley understand scoffing at someone’s too ambitious idea can lose the great deal of chance to invest in future scaling firms (ibid).  One of the most popular example is that if a person wanted to build electric car company while he did not know not only about car but also battery, he would not be assisted by the VC and engineers, however, he was helped and financed a huge amount of money and other resources because he lived in Silicon Valley and therefore Tesla became one of the largest market capitalization automobile firm in the United States, beyond Ford (ibid).  Paying forward culture can be also less likely to be settled in other areas.  This means if a founder was helped by other founders or VCs, he would assist the person who is in a similar situation with him and therefore this connection will be strengthened to the future (ibid).  These intellectual assets might not be seen in other areas even in other states in the United States.  Hence, this location advantages can be the most valuable the core knowledge management enabler for YC and their customers because if they live in other area, YC can inform them the latest knowledge created in Silicon Valley and this type of knowledge might be what the founders especially the one who are not live in Silicon Valley actually desire to learn.  YC did summarize this Silicon Valley culture and became their own assets and culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-are-the-core-knowledge-assets-in-the-organization&quot;&gt;What are the core knowledge assets in the organization?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The connection between YC alumni and investors including YC themselves might be fundamental intellectual capital built by mostly explicit knowledge about startups such as how they reach PMF.  They have their own online startup school which constructs the video lectures by YC partners, the direct communication system which if the founders want to ask them, they can do so anytime and organize articles about several specific stages which the founders would be in therefore they can be supported by them everywhere and every time.  As a result of that, YC can collect the data regarding startups especially at an early stage, which means the founders try to raise money for the first time.  More data they earn, the accuracy of the future success prediction or the odds could increase and therefore they will be able to obtain further data and positive feedback loop.  Another major core knowledge asset might be their online startup resources named library.  The library provides students and people who are interested in the program the documents, tools, template agreements, media and articles.  Almost all events YC held are recorded and shared for the online users.  It is clearly seen their efforts to make the startup management knowledge enable their potential customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-current-knowledge-management-practices&quot;&gt;The current knowledge management practices&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is some vital asymmetry of information in Series A (early stage of startups financing) between the VCs and the founders, which brings them serious disadvantages, however, YC tried to dissolve this issue to share their knowledge created by their program &lt;cite&gt;(Harris and Tam, 2020)&lt;/cite&gt;.  For example, as a result of their research, the founders spent a huge amount of time and money to yield a single term sheet (a basic condition to be invested by VCs) and they met totally 30 investors to do so on average (ibid).  To avoid or reduce this time-consuming activity, YC has provided the guide to raising series A and a standard clean series A term sheet as a template (ibid).  Therefore, YC did translate the informal knowledge which only few investors knew and took advantage of the founders into formal information which every founder can access.  Hence, they are becoming the platform for the startups especially early stage one.  Furthermore, YC is expanding their startup knowhow outside of the United States mainly Europe and China.  This is primarily because especially in Europe, European ecosystem for startups has been built and European have the confidence in respect to that as a result of the fact that the capital access is improving &lt;cite&gt;(Voices, 2018)&lt;/cite&gt;.  There are mainly 3 reasons to justify their confidence.  First of all, in fact, in the region of European startups have become the global key players such as Spotify, Skype, DeepMind, Monzo and Soundcloud with talented engineer teams (ibid).  Secondly, there are Computer Science hubs including Cambridge, Oxford, ETH Zurich and therefore most engineers graduated such universities select to join the scaling Europe born startups (ibid).  Thirdly and finally, Silicon Valley or more generally the United States are matured mainly due to the dominance of Big Tech companies such as Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook and running cost there is continuously increasing (ibid).  Accordingly, these companies are seeking their engineers outside of the United States to build their branches in Europe and hence their investment is contributing to strengthen European engineer’s job market which means European IT firms become more easily hire talented engineers then ever (ibid).  On the contrary, although YC built their branch in China in 2018 and they allow the branch full access to their key resources and independence in respect to the operations from the headquarters in Silicon Valley, suddenly they abandoned the Chinese branch &lt;cite&gt;(Liao, 2019)&lt;/cite&gt;.  This might be because the most prospective Chinese startups have already been financed and ruled by Chinese large tech companies such as Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu and therefore multinational corporations in China have almost been wiped out. They almost never successfully land in China’ according to Lu Qi who managed the Chinese YC branch (ibid).  This case could suggest that YC startup knowledge depends on western cultural context especially the American one and hence there is still some tacit knowledge referring to that.  Lu Qi of YC China clearly failed in China, however, he is still thinking why he did so.  He said that ‘When it comes to whether Chinese startups are suited for mentorship, or whether incubators bring value to China, these are separate questions’ which means he recognized the obstacle to succeed YC business in China but the issue was quite complicated and could not divide it into several aspects (ibid).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-can-be-done-to-effectively-match-knowledge-assets-and-knowledge-management-practices&quot;&gt;What can be done to effectively match knowledge assets and knowledge management practices?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YC has several type of knowledge assets mainly not only experiential knowledge assets (tacit knowledge shared through common experiences) which is matched their practice such as PMF but also systemic knowledge assets (systemized and packaged explicit knowledge) that is correlated their methods including manuals dealing with series A raising and databases according to how to build startups.   However, there is still a gap between the knowledge regarding startups written in the assets such as the documents and what the students mainly the founders actuary learned from the one &lt;cite&gt;(PALIOS, 2019)&lt;/cite&gt;.  In the programs, YC tried to space among them using face to face mentoring with the mentors for startups and alumni (ibid).  All learnings YC observed are uploaded to their online startup school and therefore the students can study the knowledge in their hometown which they used not to be able to be assisted, though the effectiveness of both methods depends on the situation which the founders are in (ibid).  When they are in the early stage before scaling their firms, the mentoring is relatively effective, however, if they are in the scaling stage, the mentoring will not be less feasible (ibid).  YC holds events to meet their customers who can also see each other.  In fact, YC launched the event to seek the person who is intelligent and gifted, like Elon Musks, especially the one who desire to employ hard tech with more inclusive way such as travel and lodging costs of participants, who appeal via a one-minute video that inquires them related to their interests, and what their potential for dignity is adjusted for whatever life situations they were born into &lt;cite&gt;(Konrad, 2019)&lt;/cite&gt;.  The conferences can be also seen as the tool to fill the gap and therefore YC might employ each service complementally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This essay has assessed the effectiveness of this firm’s current knowledge management practices and considered what requires to be done to enhance both formal and informal knowledge management practices in terms of six aspects in connection with YC, the world’s most popular venture capital.  These aspects are earned to address the definition of knowledge currently used in YC, whether this definition reflects the complexity of knowledge in YC, whether the core knowledge management enablers are in YC, what are the core knowledge assets in YC, The current knowledge management practices and what can be done to effectively match knowledge assets and knowledge management practices? respectively.  The knowledge is mainly startup incubation know how especially PMF.  The complexity of that is due to the ambiguity of PMF.  The core knowledge management enablers are the cofounders of YC such as Paul Graham, YC alumni including Airbnb founder and Silicon Valley culture equally paying forward and respect for too ambitious ideas.  The core knowledge assets are their startup acceleration resources such as video, documents, template agreements, tools and the people who are equal to the core knowledge management enablers speaking in the event or video.  The current knowledge management practices are sharing their startup resources via their startup schools, the latest of which is the guide about series A and expanding outside of the United States mainly Europe and China, however, their Chinese branch failed.  To answer what can be done to effectively match knowledge assets and knowledge management practices is the balancing among the documents, mentoring and events, especially distributing the documents via their platforms can change the situation of the people who live in the place far from the United States.  YC itself is scaling their service via their online startup school to the world.  In Europe, it can be seen the success regarding their expansion.  However, the failure in China noticed the fact that there is still a huge gap between hands-on practice in Silicon Valley and the one in non-western cultural contexts.  In spite of that, if they overcame the gap, they would be able to scale their business into non-western countries such as African and Asia-Pacific nations.  As a result, they might be able to find the next Elon Musks in such regions.  Startup incubation can be the engine of economic growth to build the innovative product which might increase human wealth and therefore their business may assist to increase not only quality of human life but also their living standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;behavioural-finance&quot;&gt;Behavioural Finance&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘The Market Is Always Wrong’ argued George Soros &lt;cite&gt;(Kaufman, 2018)&lt;/cite&gt;.  Active trading can be the prediction for the residential return of the certain financial instruments (actual return minus benchmark return such as the stock index if they trade the shares) and therefore the active traders build their portfolio based on their prediction to win the market &lt;cite&gt;(Grinold, Ronald and Khan, 1995)&lt;/cite&gt;.  His success seems to be the most famous example.  However, most passive traders argue that the active traders never win the market owing to the fact that the price in the stock market counts on almost all information hence is nearly equal to the intrinsic value and then there is no opportunity to beat passive trading such as the investment to S&amp;amp;P 500.  This essay will evaluate the passive trader’s argument in terms of behavioral finance theories and evidence and therefore also argue that although the assumption of the passive trader’s opinion mainly due to their emotional bias, still it is held by the empirical fact that index funds outperform active ones in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;active-traders-view&quot;&gt;Active trader’s view&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grinold (1989 cited in Ding, 2009) indicated that the residential return is measured by the information ratio (IR) having two factors which are the skill of the prediction (named the information coefficient, IC) and how many times traders employ their skill (called the breadth). The relationship of these indicators is formulated by Grinold as IR is equal to IC times the square root of breath (ibid).  In addition, Grinold’s claim assumed the existence of the residential return for the long term.  One of the major examples to support his assumption can be the success of the value investment such as the purchase the stocks evaluated the lower price in comparison with book value or earnings &lt;cite&gt;(Ackert and Deaves, 2010)&lt;/cite&gt;.  Hence, the high skilled active trader might be able to earn the residential return.  This measurement also implies that even if a trader has relatively low skill, there is an opportunity to beat the market to increase the breadth (ibid).  However, if the assumption could hold, it would lead the contradiction to the argument of the passive traders.  This is because their statement based on the efficient markets hypothesis (EMH) that the price in the market reflects all information even not publicly available including insider’s one as the form of EMH is strong (ibid).  This means, for example, if the trader forecasted the prospectively of a firm, the price of the company would count on his prediction and therefore he would be able to buy or sell his securities at the price which he thought it would be underestimated or overestimated and then the chance to purchase or short the undervalued or overvalued shares would be dismissed immediately after that, which is called no arbitrage condition (ibid).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;validation-of-emh-by-the-traders-emotion&quot;&gt;Validation of EMH by the trader’s emotion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the major foundations of EMH is this condition, however, the assumption has been disputed (ibid).  This is primarily because of the low liquidity of the market, which means even if the traders want to short the low liquid stocks, he might not be able to do so owing to the fact that he may not be able to find the counterparty to do so or even if he find them, the high transaction cost may exploit his revenue for the trade (ibid).  In addition, major traders in the hedge funds are denied short selling which might deteriorate mispricing the securities by speculators &lt;cite&gt;(Barberis and Thaler, 2003)&lt;/cite&gt;.  Hence, the arrogation is less likely to hold due to these reasons.  In addition, the experienced traders are likely to regulate their emotion in the decision making and then their performance might be better than junior traders, however, still they could be biased by their sentiments and therefore they might wrongly price the securities &lt;cite&gt;(Fenton-O’Creevy et al, 2012)&lt;/cite&gt;.  There are some biases such as home bias (the tendency that the trader invests in the domestic market rather than unfamiliar foreign markets) which can lead to a less diversified portfolio and therefore their performance might be less than the unbiased one (Ackert and Deaves, 2010).  However, the more important ones are self-attribution bias, hindsight bias and confirmation bias (ibid).  This is because these biases might be contributed to the persistence of overconfidence which is that the traders incline to overestimate their skill (ibid).  These biases is defined as that people tend to overestimate the contribution for the success while undervalue the one for the failure, that they incline to exaggerate the predictability of a certain event and that they are likely to discover the evidence consistent with their belief while ignore conflicted information respectively (ibid).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;traders-sentiment-as-a-source-of-market-anomalies&quot;&gt;Trader’s sentiment as a source of market anomalies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, the implication of self-attribution bias in the trading can be short-run momentum and long-term reversals, which mean when the traders receive new positive signal for a stock, they tend to overvalue the price of the stock more than the intrinsic value in the short term while underestimate the effect for the price in the long term &lt;cite&gt;(DANIEL, HIRSHLEIFER and SUBRAHMANYAM, 1998)&lt;/cite&gt;.  This is empirically observed as short-run positive autocorrelations of the stock return and long-run negative ones, both of which can be consistent with and realize the anomalies in the market as a counter example against EMH (ibid).  Other significant emotional factors affecting the performance can be strong desire to avoid missing out or the sentiment of regret.  For instance, the traders are more likely to realize returns than losses and therefore, especially risk averters incline to earn lower performance due to the fact that they tend to hold their shares in quite a long time &lt;cite&gt;(Alsharman, Fairchild and Hinvest, 2016)&lt;/cite&gt;.    In fact, according to the prospect theory and its empirical evidence, the utilities of gain and loss might not be symmetry (ibid).  This means people tend to require more premium against potential loss.  For instance, the researchers ask the subjects in the experiment what gain would they demand for the coin tosses having a fair odd of fifty-fifty where loss is $50 (ibid).  Most subjects call for the loss $125 which is 2.5 times higher than the loss (ibid).  This phenomenon is called loss aversion which also might lead to the anomalies.  Although EMH assumes universal utility function with rational investors, the asymmetry between gains and losses is inconsistent with the assumption &lt;cite&gt;(Ackert and Deaves, 2010)&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;empirical-superiority-of-index-funds&quot;&gt;Empirical superiority of index funds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, top 10 active funds could hardly outperform the most index funds including the worst one even if they omitted their management fees &lt;cite&gt;(Crane and Crotty, 2018)&lt;/cite&gt;.  Especially after counting on the residential risk adjustments, the index funds tend to exceed active funds apparently in terms of their risk adjusted return (ibid).  Therefore, the market, even high liquidity one has the anomalies due to biased traders, however, the ones might not lead to the existence of the residential return in the long term.  At least, EMH requires the unpredictability of the anomalies &lt;cite&gt;(Ackert and Deaves, 2010)&lt;/cite&gt;.  The superiority of index funds could be consistent with the requirement of the market efficiency, which means the traders may not be able to forecast the anomaly using data they collect.  This can be because clouding out the affection of trader’s sentiment and therefore the traders are less likely to predict whether the anomalies occurred by the trader’s biases affect positively or negatively even if they can forecast when the ones appear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;algorithmic-trading-as-a-competitor-of-the-index-funds&quot;&gt;Algorithmic trading as a competitor of the index funds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most traders can be biased; however, active trading can implement without them using the computers which is called algorithmic trading (AT).  Among of AT, especially high-frequency trading (HFT) can be one of the most prospective active trading strategies.  This is because some researchers indicated that the average HFT companies outperformed the index funds in terms of their risk adjusted residential returns in the E-mini S&amp;amp;P 500 futures market which is one of the highest liquidity and the most efficient market in the world &lt;cite&gt;(Baron, Brogaard and Kirilenko, 2014)&lt;/cite&gt;.  This may mean that a great deal of breath (transaction) is likely to lead higher performance even if they have relatively low skill (the ability of prediction).  It seems to be a counterexample for the superiority of index funds. However, this transaction speed race apparently will be won and dominated by only few firms which can invest a huge money into the machine that can detect and correspond to the earning chance at first (ibid).  Therefore, the cost to build the system may overcome their residential return as a result of the competition.  In addition, the US futures markets such as NYSE and CBOE have already imposed the speed limitation for the trading to set off the speed advantage, for example, the slower traders have an opportunity to cancel their transaction before the faster ones execute the deal &lt;cite&gt;(Henderson, 2019)&lt;/cite&gt;.  Hence, the chance to earn residential return of HTF firms might be dismissed in the long term.   Furthermore, some researchers indicated that the active funds using comprehensively AT are likely to earn lower holding profits and higher interim trading returns than in terms of the risk adjusted residential return, however, they seem to earn lower total one than the active funds with lower intensively AT &lt;cite&gt;(Fong, Parwada and Yang, 2018)&lt;/cite&gt;.  This may mean that the transaction cost setoff the interim trading and hence AT do not lead to the higher return than non-AT active funds (ibid).  This can be because AT incline to increase the number of transactions more than lower intensive AT funds.  Therefore, it can be also concluded that although AT can eliminate the bias of the traders, it may not be able to earn higher profits than index funds because they tend to do so than the most active funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This essay has discussed the statement of the passive trader which is that no one can beat the market (index funds) in terms of behavioral finance theories and evidences such as the validation of EMH by the trader’s sentiment, the one’s sentiment as a source of market anomalies, the empirical superiority of index funds and AT as a competitor of the index funds.  As a result of considerations, it is claimed that even if the emotion of the investors builds the anomalies, it may not be predictable and short lived.  Only few exceptions can be HFT, however, it has been restricted by the regulators and suffered from the increase in IT development costs hence, it may no longer earn the residential return in the long term.  More generally, AT funds could earn lower return than other active funds which could do so than the index funds.  Therefore, elimination of the emotion may not contribute the greater performance than not only the one by emotional active fund managers but also the passive funds.  Thus, it is concluded in this essay that the passive funds tend to have the higher performance than active funds even if the passive traders’ assumptions of EMH do not hold mainly because of the sentiment of the traders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the start-ups were hard to build financial services such as payment.  This primary was because the bank used to spend 75% of their IT budget to maintain their financial service &lt;cite&gt;(Strange, 2019)&lt;/cite&gt;.  However, Amazon Web Services (AWS) has changed this situation due to providing them IT infrastructure as a service and therefore, they can start the financial service business with quite cheaper than ever (ibid).  Although the banking business is supplied as a service owing to AWS and other cloud computing providers, it is not required to supply all banking functions (fraud, regulatory, data, payment, core systems and license) as a unit (ibid).  Although now there are a great deal of certain function banking service providers (called FinTech), this essay will focus on Stripe which is the one of the largest online (mainly mobile) payment service providers.  This is because the forecast says the global mobile payment market is rapidly growing with approximately 30% GACR (2018-2026) which means the market will be roughly 7 times larger than in 2018 &lt;cite&gt;(Fortune Business Insights, 2020)&lt;/cite&gt;.  The hospitality and transportation sector are the fastest (35% GACR) and emerging economies in Asia-Pacific are growing more rapidly than any other region, the remarkable example of which is China having a half of world mobile payment transactions (PRIME INDEXES, 2019).  This is mainly due to the online payment innovation called Payment Facilitator (or ‘PayFac’) which completely shortened the merchant onboarding operation &lt;cite&gt;(CB Insights, 2020)&lt;/cite&gt;.  Therefore, the mobile payment industry could be one of the attractive markets and Stripe might play the important role of the market owing to their presence in the market because it is one of the first firms to use PayFac technology (ibid).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;economic-analysis-of-the-mobile-payment-industry&quot;&gt;Economic Analysis of the Mobile Payment Industry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the main reasons why mobile payment is rising can be to remove the pain points in the customer experience of the payment process which is becoming more complex due to E-commerce and the ramification of merchant landing pages &lt;cite&gt;(Goldman Sachs, 2017)&lt;/cite&gt;.  The buyers of these platforms are not only end-users (2.1 billion in the world in 2019 and potentially 60% of the world population by 2025 because of the wide spreading mobile phone) who are mainly millennials but also the businesses such as merchants &lt;cite&gt;(THE PAYPERS BV, 2019)&lt;/cite&gt;.  Functionally, the major alternatives of this service are other types of payment method mainly including credit card and debit one because of which four fifth of the transaction by the millenniums delivered on these cards and they considered the payment by the ones is the easiest way (ibid).  This is because they think there are several security filters to pay by the mobile payment, which leads them to hesitate to do so (ibid).  As well as the demand side, Fintech firms including Stripe are not the only one major supplier of the mobile payment market.  The traditional players such as banks and financial institutions are also, the example of which 89% of them in the United States is offering mobile banking services &lt;cite&gt;(PRIME INDEXES, 2019)&lt;/cite&gt;.  In addition, tech giants (Google and Apple) and electronics (Samsung) are doing so mobile payment apps which prefixed their own brand name, as a result of which 3 apps will dominate 56% of this market in the US according to Juniper Research (ibid).  However, Starbucks’ mobile app was the most common mobile payment platform in the US until 2019 in terms of the number of users and still is more popular than Google and Samsung Pay (Merchant Savvy, 2020).  This can be because the customers are likely to use for low-cost, high-frequency purchases including coffee in Starbucks owing to not only more smooth purchase transactions but also loyalty and rewards programs offered by certain merchants &lt;cite&gt;(ELECTRONIC TRANSACTIONS ASSOCIATION, 2019)&lt;/cite&gt;.  In addition, there are the difference of the preference about how many mobile payment apps the customers prefer to install, the major example of which East Asian countries such as China and South Korea may prefer to do so only one app, however, the other area including the United States may not hesitate to do so several apps &lt;cite&gt;(Merchant Savvy, 2020)&lt;/cite&gt;.  This can allow Stripe and other mobile platformers to the more opportunities to enter this industry especially in the US, however, credit card and debit card are used in 41% and 34% of point of sales spending by value in North America in 2018 according to Worldpay’s World Payments Report &lt;cite&gt;(ELECTRONIC TRANSACTIONS ASSOCIATION, 2019)&lt;/cite&gt;.  This may mean these cards are stronger competitors rather than other mobile payment platformers as for Stripe.  This might be because the customers in the area have ‘security fears’ to use the mobile payment (ibid).  In fact, roughly a half of them pointed out the fear was the main reason to prevent using the one (ibid).  Therefore, it can be said the structure of the mobile payment market in the world (except China dominated by only two firms including Alibaba and Tencent) is closing to oligopoly which Stripe and other few competitors such as Ayden and PayPal (Braintree) from nearly perfect competition due to low entry barrier which only requires to be approved by Financial Services Authority (FSA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;economic-analysis-of-stripe&quot;&gt;Economic Analysis of Stripe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stripe is an online API based payment platformer with the mission which is ‘increasing the global GDP of the internet’ &lt;cite&gt;(Jewell and Marden, 2018)&lt;/cite&gt;.  Their platform has also well documented manuals and then has high integrity for the system of the clients (ibid).  This is primarily because they ‘believe that payments are a problem rooted in code, not finance’ and therefore, they concentrate to decrease implementation time to integrate their platform into the merchant’s web sites &lt;cite&gt;(Goldman Sachs, 2017)&lt;/cite&gt;.  As a result of the concentration, the integration time is shortened from more than 6 months to only a few minutes (just added a few codes in the web sites whose user interfaces are unchanged) (ibid).  Their business model is mainly dependent on a per-transaction basis, the example of which when the client product is sold via their payment system, they can earn some portion of the price and therefore as the revenue of the client is increased, their revenue is also raised (ibid).  In fact, in general, they impose a fixed rate of 2.9% + 30 cents per transaction, however, the fee is changed by the volume of transactions and the geographic location which the merchants are in &lt;cite&gt;(Murray, 2019)&lt;/cite&gt;.  In the UK, the fee per transaction also depends on the cards which the customers use in the merchants, the example of which they are imposed at 1.4% + 20p for a European card or 2.9% +20 p for a non-European card (ibid).  This means the merchants can deliver the international purchase transactions only with slightly higher fee (for example 1.5% additionally charged in the UK) at least within Europe.  Stripe focuses on only businesses, especially small- and medium-sized ones, which is the major difference of PayPal and therefore their revenue is estimated at $450 million as a result of a $20 billion transaction by value in 2015 (ibid).  In addition, as a result of counting on their direct sales model (marketing cost such as CAC can be quite low) and low infrastructure cost (AWS and it do only charge for the amount of actual usage which means almost zero fixed costs to operate the platform presumably only except employee salary and rent fee), the profit margin is estimated around 55 %, which is better than industrial average (around 20%) (CB Insights, 2020). Hence the cost structure of Stripe can be said to be relatively competitive in this industry.  Furthermore, Stripe is a relatively software developer oriented firm, one of the main reasons for which it has the community of them and therefore the capability of integration for other services is stronger than the competitors because they prefer to work in Stripe rather than other firms &lt;cite&gt;(Benson, 2018)&lt;/cite&gt;.  This can be because they prefer to introduce their payment platform into new technology such as AI.  For instance, a new product (called Radar) can detect fraud transactions in the purchase processing to monitor in real time and score them based on the historical data trend and therefore as the tool has more data, the accuracy of the capability to detect potentially fraudulent transactions can increase, which may mean it has the strong sales and operating synergy for the payment platform &lt;cite&gt;(CB Insights, 2020)&lt;/cite&gt;.  One of the largest benefits to using their online payment platform can be increasing client firm’s revenue.  In fact, the conversion rate of some clients increased by 2-3% due to smoother payment process (or faster processing time) by their platform, which means it also increased the satisfaction of client’s customer purchase experience and therefore on average they could increase by 7% of client firm revenue &lt;cite&gt;(Jewell and Marden, 2018)&lt;/cite&gt;.  Another major benefit can be that their payment platform can reduce the operational cost of the clients.  This is because the cost of development and maintenance for the payment platform is 24% cheaper than competitor’s average (ibid).  Hence from the economic perspective, it can be said that the opportunity cost of the usage of moderate payment platforms is higher than Stripe payment platform and therefore, they have a competitive advantage not only for building payment systems from the scratch but also average competitors.  In addition, it also has the function to prevent the fraud of purchase transactions (ibid).  According to LexisNexis (a legal firm), generally, every $1 of fraudulent purchase transactions charges an online trade an additional $2.62 (ibid).  Therefore, it can be said their payment system can reduce the costs of the clients to prevent fraud.  Furthermore, on general, mobile payment can be more secure than other type of payment method due to tokenized transaction which means the card number cannot be seen at the point of sales and encrypting the sales information immediately after the customers purchase &lt;cite&gt;(ELECTRONIC TRANSACTIONS ASSOCIATION, 2019)&lt;/cite&gt;.  Hence, Stripe can offer the secure purchase transaction via their mobile payment platform, which means the merchants can reduce security costs to introduce the mobile payment such as Stripe one.  Time can be a major scarce resource and therefore rapid integration into the client’s landing pages could lead Stripe to competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This essay has discussed the mobile payment industry and the key supplier (Stripe) in terms of economics.  It has several competitive advantages including the fraud prevention, lower marketing and operating costs (higher profit margin, 55% around), rapid integration without any change of the user interface of the merchant’s web pages and the strong developer’s community.  In addition, the industry is growing rapidly (more than GACR 30%), however, the number of suppliers is also rising and therefore the profitability of the firms might be decreased as a result of competitions.  Furthermore, the credit card firms such as Visa and Mastercard can be still the largest competitor in terms of payment.  This is because the client’s customers still have the fear of security for mobile payment even though technically it is more secure than a credit card.  In the future remark, whichever mobile payment system such as digital wallet (Apple Pay) or gateway (Stripe) the merchants select, they finally have to be authorized, done clearing and the settlement by card network of Visa and Mastercard which can charge the same amount of the fee Stripe can earn according to Goldman Sucks (2017).  Therefore, even if mobile payment penetrated and dominated the payment process, still the credit firms can earn profit due to the assessments.  Hence Stripe has mainly two options, first of which is becoming the authority like Visa or second of that introduces blockchain which is not required to the central clearing and authorization.&lt;/p&gt;
