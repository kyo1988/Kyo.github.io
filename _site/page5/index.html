<p>This is a modified version of the report for Understanding Finance (Part 1: Investment Appraisal – Eastern plc Assessment Standard) in Bath Full Time MBA Class of 2020.</p>

<h1 id="investment-appraisal--eastern-plc-assessment-standard">Investment Appraisal – Eastern plc Assessment Standard</h1>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This report will answer the requirements of this coursework.  These issues are to prepare the NPV calculation for Eastern plc, to explain what the cost of capital of 8% represents and to comment on whether and how this investment may contribute to shareholder wealth.</p>

<h2 id="preparing-the-npv-calculation-for-eastern-plc">Preparing the NPV calculation for Eastern plc</h2>
<p>As a result of the calculation, the NPV of this investment is approximately £9.2 millions or more precisely £91,931,456.  This NPV is calculated to sum up the discounted cash flows in the life of project including the end of year 5 which the plant and equipment, which the company is going to invest, will be disposed.  Each discounted cash flow is computed to multiply the net cash flow by discount rate which is equal to the cost of capital (8%).  The net cash flow or free cash flow if the company financed by only equity is the cash flow which subtracts of all obligatory payments from gross profit adding the depreciation.  The gross profit will be estimated to 35% of the sales which is going to earn selling 4 million units per year with the current price of £2.50, however, the price is expected to inflate by 4% per year.  The depreciation is emulated using the Straight Line Basis method which means the investment subtracting from disposal value (£0.15 millions) is divided by life of project (5 years).  The obligatory payments are the investment, fixed cost, tax payable and working capital change in this case.  £2 millions of investment in new plant and machinery will be paid immediately and the remains (£6 millions) will do so at the end of the first year.  The fixed cost is estimated be £2 million per year, however, this includes the depreciation (£1.57 millions), and therefore the actual fixed cost will be £0.43 millions per year.  The tax payable is reckoned to multiply tax rate (20%) by taxable income which is to subtract gross profit from depreciation and fixed cost.  The working capital change of a year is determined to subtract the working capital of 1 year later as of the year from the working capital of the year which will be maintained at 10% of the following year’s sales.  The detail of calculation is in the MS Excel sheet which is also uploaded with this report.</p>

<h2 id="explaining-what-the-cost-of-capital-of-8-represents">Explaining what the cost of capital of 8% represents</h2>
<p>What the cost of capital of 8% represents can be the minimum rate of return on the prospective investment projects as for the investors, who are supplying funds for Eastern plc.  In addition, it can be also the degree of risk to invest this investment.  Therefore, if Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) theory hold and this cost of capital is financed by only equity, the investors require almost 7.2% premium for the risk of this investment owing to the fact that 10 years British government bond rate is 0.79%, which used as a risk free rate.  Moreover, if the theory hold, this additional risk premium might depend on the company’s beta.  According to Statista, the average market risk premium in the United Kingdom, 2019 is 6.2% and therefore, the market implied the company’s beta can be approximately 1.12.  This means the company might be more sensitive than the whole market return.  In comparison with other London stock exchange listed plastic companies such as Daios Plastics SA having beta 0.0133 and Lordos United Plastics Public Ltd with beta 0.0237, the risk can be significantly higher than competitors and therefore the investors require higher return for the company.  This can be because the structure of asset might be weighted to debt which the lenders own less business risk than stockholders if the assumption that the cost pf capital is financed by only equity relax.</p>

<h2 id="comment-on-whether-and-how-this-investment-may-contribute-to-shareholder-wealth">Comment on whether and how this investment may contribute to shareholder wealth</h2>
<p>This investment may contribute to shareholder wealth.  This is mainly because the NPV is a positive with a large cash flow owing to relatively highly competitive advantage of the company only if the sales figure is feasible.  Therefore, this investment will earn a large amount of free cash flows which they are expecting and then those cash flow will be back to the investors as a dividend.  The depreciation using the Straight-Line Basis method can be affected the NPV positively because if they adopted the other method, they would have to pay more cash flow as depreciation and then the NPV will reduce more than using Straight Line Basis.</p>

<h1 id="will-index-funds-continue-to-beat-active-funds">Will index funds continue to beat active funds?</h1>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Today, only a few active funds can compete with index ones.  As for most individual investors, investing ETFs (Exchange traded funds) or other index funds can be the best option.  Moody’s Investors Service anticipated passive investment will outweigh active ones in the United States until 2021 <cite>(Kim and Cho, 2019)</cite>.  Therefore, most active fund managers will no longer be able to charge the fund fee.  As a matter of fact, according to figure 1, the fund fee, even asset weighted average one, has been decreasing steadily as active fund fee has done so <cite>(Platt, 2019)</cite>.</p>

<h2 id="unethical-issues">Unethical Issues</h2>
<p>However, these investment trends might involve several problems such as gender and unethical issues.  One of the major dilemmas is to invest the funds indirectly if the companies indexed by the funds act unethically.  In fact, no less than half of United States listed companies income was created from alcohol cannabis or tobacco <cite>(Nauman, 2019)</cite>.  This means the investors are in favor of such corporation revenue taking activities at least circumlocutory.  In addition, investing the fund can be equal to advocating gender bias.  To illustrate this, the number of female hedge fund employees was less than a fifth of the total employees <cite>(Fortado, 2019)</cite>.</p>

<h2 id="correct-index-funds">‘Correct’ Index Funds</h2>
<p>To avoid the issue, the Investors can choose ethically or politically correct index funds such as ETFs having a gender lens and higher environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria <cite>(Bolshaw, 2019)</cite>.  However, the most critical matter for the investors is to earn enough money, which has to be at least bigger than the deposit rate or the government bond one.  There is a tendency for women led funds to gain higher revenue than male one <cite>(Fortado, 2019)</cite>.  This might mean even if the investors select ethically appropriate ETFs, it may earn the expected income.  Therefore, this passive funds preference probably does not change.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>As a result of this trend, there may be new arbitrage opportunities.  Michael Burry argued that the tendency in passive investment through ETFs and index funds, as well as the trend to quite large size among asset managers has strayed smaller cap stocks without exception <cite>(Kim and Cho, 2019)</cite>.  According to his statement, if this direction continues, non listed small cap stocks will be undervalued more than ever.  Consequently, these companies may not collect the money to expand the current business or build a new one from the capital market.  However, in this situation, the small cap funds can overcome the passive ones as for the revenue.  This may mean active funds oriented for smaller cap might beaten ETFs.  As a consequence, the index funds will dominate or have already done, though, the dominance will no longer last.</p>

<h1 id="the-inflation-rate-boj-and-government-are-fighting">The Inflation rate BoJ and government are fighting</h1>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>These graphs (see figures 1) describe the past and the possible future forecast trend of the Japanese inflation rate; the right hand graph represents the core Consumer Prices Index (CPI) and is mainly discussed here. The core CPI presents the change in the price of goods and services except for the food and energy sectors, which are quite volatile and therefore most market practitioners strongly believe they should not be included in such economic measurements. However, the headline inflation rate can be included in them, which seems to be the nominal inflation rate that best reflects actual people’s purchasing power.</p>

<h2 id="importance-of-inflation-rate">Importance of Inflation Rate</h2>
<p>Most economists believe that a rising Inflation rate can be important for a national economy because the nominal gross domestic product (GDP), which is defined as the real GDP plus the inflation rate, can reflect the national wealth. This means that if the GDP grows faster, people will become richer (and may be happier). However, Japan’s nominal GDP growth rate, which was almost zero, was slower than other countries, even other advanced economies such as in the UK and United States for about 20 years since 1995.</p>

<h2 id="boj-challenge">BoJ Challenge</h2>
<p>The Bank of Japan (BoJ) and the jJapanese government have been struggling to increase the inflation rate (the core CPI) to the target rate (2.0%) by using monetary policies such as quantitative easing since April 2016. This is because Japan suffered deflation from 1995 to 2016. During this period, It is apparent from figure 1 that the trend of the core CPI or inflation rate (see figure 1) fluctuated between -0.5% and 1%. Owing to this, the target inflation rate could not be realized. In addition, the future inflation rate will still not reach the target within five years. This can be demonstrated by the current five-year inflation swaps rate which reflects the market expectation for the future inflation rate, when it is still below 2.0%. This means traders believe that even in the longer term the Japanese inflation rate is quite likely to be below the target.</p>

<p>Most market participants analysts agree with the view that the lower inflation rate can result in a lower bond yield because there is a strong relation between the inflation rate and government bond rate, which seems to be equal to the interest rate or deposit rate. In Japan, the lowest Japanese government bond (JGB) yield has actually reached a minus rate, for example, -0.1%.</p>

<p>Once Shirakawa, who was the former governor of the BoJ, took a position that they have no capability to control the inflation rate until April 2016. On the contrary, Kuroda, who took over the governorship of BoJ and Abe, who is the current prime minister of Japan, argued that BoJ can manage this rate using the monetary and fiscal policy, so called Abenomics, which started then and was supported by the “Reflationist” economists. However, they still could not control the inflation rate in spite of the fact that they took all measures they could such as purchases of private sector assets, in particular, the equity ETFs and JGB, therefore, some people, especially the anti-Reflationist economists criticized Abe, Kuroda and the Reflationist economists.</p>

<h2 id="mmt-and-economic-schools">MMT and Economic schools</h2>
<p>The answer of which school is more likely to be correct is further complicated by the existence of a new school called Modern Monetary Theory (MMT). The MMT school and the Reflationists argued that the government annual budget constraint might frustrate achievement of the target inflation rate. This is because they believe the government is fearful of deteriorating the primary surplus which occurs when the government taxes more than it spends.</p>

<p>Most mainstream economists said that If the primary balance worsened and became a deficit, uncontrollable inflation would occur due to the sharp increase of JGB rate, which means if investors are concerned about debt sustainability, they would never buy JGBs. In addition, they said that while the BoJ and government might be able to cause inflation, they could not control the rate. They also pointed out that at one time Japan experienced hyperinflation, which was almost 40%, only after World War II. However, the MMT school argued that as long as a country such as Japan, the UK and the United States borrows in its own currency and can do so, they will never fall into bankruptcy because they have a central bank and the bank can create money.</p>

<h2 id="japan-and-europes-economic-situation">Japan and Europe’s Economic Situation</h2>
<p>Japan is also concerned about aging and its population decrease, especially the labor force, which has already reached the peak. In addition, most pensioners may want there to be deflation. There are quite many and if inflation occurred, their purchasing power would decrease due to the lapse of the inflation slide of the social wealth system, which means even if the inflation occurs, the amount of a pension payment will not be counted in this situation immediately. In addition, some investors think in terms of the consolidated government, which is the state’s and the central bank’s balance sheet taken together, Japanese primary deficit has been almost balanced. This can be one of the main reasons hyperinflation has never occurred in spite of the fact that Japanese government’s primary deficit Is about 2% of GDP and government debt is huge, which amounts to about 200% of GDP. Furthermore, this is supported to the fact that the Japan 5 Years CDS value is 23.1 (as of 1 June 2019), which means the market practitioners believe there is only a 0.39% implied probability of default.</p>

<p>The low inflation rate problem is not only in Japan but also in the Eurozone, in particular, Germany. The German government bond rate reached almost zero percent, which is quite similar to the JGB yield. Some economists have recognized that the Euro zone, particularly Germany, Spain, Italy and France has been Japanizing. In addition, they do not have their own central bank, therefore, they cannot deliver the monetary policy separately which means fiscal policy is the only measure to stimulate their economy. However, the EU restrict countries’ primary balance, therefore, some European countries, especially Italy, having a huge primary deficit have almost no option to do so.</p>

<p>Now Japan has also the primary deficit then has a few measures to stimulate the economy, which means what Japanese government should prioritize in terms of spending can be important. They have planned to increase the minimum wage and to put up the consumption tax rate, which is quite similar to the value added tax (VAT), from 8% to 10% in October. In addition, Olivier Blanchard and Takeshi Tashiro, who belongs to The Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE), suggested they should spend money to raise the fertility rate because they calculated if increased in the fertility rate from 1.45 (current Japanese rate and about 0.2% higher than Italian and Spanish rate) to 1.80 (almost the same as British and American rate) GDP would be about 6% higher in 30 years and 17% higher after 50 years. This means the information rate can increase as the fertility rate rises.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Some people said that today Japan can be an experimental station for fiscal-monetary policy. If the Japanese government can manage the inflation rate, other countries such as Europe would also be saved.</p>
